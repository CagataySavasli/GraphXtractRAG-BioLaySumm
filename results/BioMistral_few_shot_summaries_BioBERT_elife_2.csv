"Imagine a gymnastics competition in which participants take turns to cartwheel and somersault across the floor . The routines on display comprise sequences of precisely timed movements learned through practice . This is also true for many of the actions we perform every day , such as reaching for a cup of coffee . A region of the brain called the cerebellum helps us learn sequences of movements . But how does it do this ? To find out , Khilkevich et al . came up with a new version of an old experiment . Rabbits were first trained to blink their eye in response to a specific external cue . This type of learning , called associative learning , has been shown before in the cerebellum . But Khilkevich et al . wondered whether the cerebellum could also use internal feedback signals from the eyeblink as a cue to learn the next movement ? If so , this might explain how the cerebellum can chain movements together in a sequence . As predicted , Khilkevich et al . found that rabbits could learn to blink their eye in response to an initial signal , and then blink again in response to the first blink . Control experiments confirmed that the second eyeblink was coupled to the first , and not to the original cue . Moreover , on many trials the rabbits showed a third and even fourth eyeblink . This is because feedback signals from the first , second or third blink were the same . Thus , the feedback signals from the first blink triggered the second blink , feedback from the second triggered the third , and so forth . Rabbits could also learn to use a blink of the left eye as a cue for a blink of the right eye . Similar patterns of neuronal activity accompanied each blink , suggesting that the same mechanism generated them all . The cerebellum can thus use feedback from one movement as a cue to learn the proper timing of the next movement in a sequence . A key question is whether this mechanism of sequence learning extends beyond movement . The cerebellum has extensive connections to the brain’s outer layer , the cortex , including many areas involved in cognition . Future experiments should test whether the cerebellum might help guide sequences of cortical activity during cognitive tasks ."," Researchers wanted to figure out how the ""memory"" of individual actions is stored in the brain. They did this by having rabbits perform a certain action, followed by another action, and then repeating those actions over time. They found that the second action happened sooner than expected, suggesting that the memory of the first action helped the animal remember what to do next. They think this happens because the brain stores memories of actions separately, rather than as a whole sequence. This finding helps us understand how the brains of people with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's Disease store and retrieve memories. It also gives researchers ideas about how to design artificial intelligence systems that mimic the brain's storage methods. For example, robots could be programmed to break down tasks into small parts, making it easier for them to complete complicated tasks. This could make robots smarter and more efficient. Overall, this research sheds light on how the human brain works and how we can use that knowledge to improve technology. That's pretty cool! And you thought neuroscience class was boring... who knew it could be so interesting? Just keep reading, you never know what else you might discover!

"To grow and multiply , a living cell must take a variety of factors into account , such as its own energy levels and the availability of nutrients . A protein called mTOR sits at the core of a signaling pathway that integrates these and other sources information . Problems with the mTOR pathway contribute to several diseases including diabetes and cancer . The mTOR protein occurs in two distinct protein complexes , called mTORC1 and mTORC2 . These complexes contain a mix of other proteins – known as accessory proteins . They also sense different cues and act upon distinct targets in the cell . Recent research reported the structure of mTORC1 , which provided clues about how this complex works . Yet , much less was known about the mTORC2 complex . Stuttfeld , Aylett et al . have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the three-dimensional architecture of the human version of mTORC2 . Comparing the new mTORC2 structure to the existing one for mTORC1 showed that they have many features in common but important differences too . The overall shape of both complexes is similar and each complex contains two copies of mTOR arranged in a similar way . Also , the main accessory proteins in each complex interact with almost the exact same parts of mTOR , but the accessory proteins in mTORC2 are organized differently from those of mTORC1 . The different accessory proteins also have distinct shapes . These differences could help to explain why the complexes respond to different cues and recognize different targets . These new findings provide an entry point for further studies on how mTORC2 works in cells . The next step is to get a higher resolution image of the structure of this complex to see the finer details of all the components . This may in the future help scientists to develop drugs that inhibit mTORC2 to treat cancer and other diseases ."," The authors wanted to learn more about something called ""human mTORS2"" (shortened to just ""mTORS"") because it plays an important job inside cells. They already knew that mTOS forms a group (a ""complex"") with several other things inside cells to make sure that the right amount of energy is being used. There are actually two types of these complexes (""mTORT1"" and ""mTOCR2""), but the focus here is on the second kind. The authors had learned some things about mTORD2 before from studying it in a type of cell that isn't human (""Sf12""). But now they wanted to know what it looked like in human cells. So, they did lots of experiments involving mixing certain chemicals together, freezing them, looking at them under a special camera, and figuring out where everything was supposed to go. Then, they figured out what mTOD2 looks like! And they also figured out why it doesn't respond to a medicine called ""rapamacyin"". That might sound weird, but sometimes medicines only work on certain kinds of things, even though those things need the medicine to work properly. Anyway, the authors think that learning more about how mTord2 works will help people who get sick from things like diabetes, cancer, and brain problems. Because mTod2 is linked to those diseases, and maybe treating them somehow involves making drugs that work really well with mTOrd2. Or something like that. Yay science! 1) What does the word “architecture” mean? 2) What do the words “gradient,” “pooled,” “concentrated,” “directly used,” “fixation,” “glutaradleyde,” “secondary antibody,” and “HRP” mean, and what are ""goat anti rabbit,"" ""Ab67121,"" and ""abcam""? 3) Why did the scientists want to learn about the ""architectue"" of mToRD2? Did someone ask them to? Were people confused about how big mToDR2 was? Is mToR2 mad at people? Does mToRC2 have feelings? 4) How did the scientist figure out what the ""intermediate resolution"" of the picture of mtoR2 was going to look like? Did they take a bunch of pictures and then pick the best one? Did one person draw what they thought it would look"
"Our sense of number is thought to have emerged from the circuits of cortical neurons in the brain that originally represent space , a process known as 'cortical recycling' . Accordingly , our perception of space and number are tightly intertwined: for example , people think about numbers on a mental number line , where smaller numbers are mapped to the left , and larger numbers are mapped to the right . Also , damage to a brain region called the parietal cortex disrupts both space and number processing . If number processing recycles the neurons that encode space , which form does this appropriation take ? Recycling could preserve the original behavior of the neurons ( processing space ) , thus enriching the neurons’ functional repertoire with a new capacity ( processing number ) . Alternatively , the newly developed role could replace the original one , such that space and number cohabitate the same brain area but use separate neurons . To disentangle these hypotheses , Schwiedrzik et al . used a technique called 'perceptual adaptation' . Here , continuously showing someone a particular feature eventually exhausts the neurons that respond to that feature . Neurons that respond to the opposite feature are however less exhausted and dominate perception . Consequently , people perceive the opposite of what they are adapted to . For example , after continuously seeing dots moving to the right , people perceive stationary dots as moving to the left . Similarly , after being exposed to large numbers of dots they underestimate how many dots they see . If the same neurons process numbers and space , then adapting to movement in a particular direction should influence number perception . During Schwiedrzik et al . ’s experiments , volunteers watched moving dots on a computer screen . After seeing dots move to the right , they underestimated the number of dots that then appeared on the screen . This is likely to be because larger numbers are mentally mapped to the right , and seeing rightward motion for a long time exhausted these neurons . This means that neurons that respond to smaller numbers ( mentally mapped to the left ) were more active when the new dots were presented , leading the volunteers to underestimate how many dots they saw . Adapting to leftward motion led to the opposite effect , with volunteers overestimating the number of dots . Thus , motion can literally move us up and down the number line . These results indicate that the same neurons encode both space and numbers . Cortical recycling does not erase the neurons’ original behavior: instead , neurons may carry out the same computations when processing numbers or space . This would allow the brain to add new functionality without sacrificing any of the computational resources for processing space .","People can estimate the number or quantity of things like dots or squares just by looking at them. They can also tell how far away something is just by glancing at it. Both abilities seem linked to the same part of the mind. To figure out why, scientists flashed a series of dots in different locations and asked people to judge how many there were. Then they flashed the dots to the side and asked the same question. Scientists found that judging the number to the “left” makes people think there are fewer dots than there really are. Judging the dotted to the ”right” makes them think there’s more. So, the farther to the LEFT the doted were, the FEWER people thought there were, and the farther TO THE RIGHT, the MORE people thought. That means that the thing your eyes see on the left side of your screen makes your brain think of smaller numbers! And vice versa. That shows us that the part of your brain that counts numbers is also the part that thinks about distance. That helps us learn about how the mind works and how different abilities are connected. That knowledge can help doctors treat patients with brain injuries. It can also teach us how to make computers work smarter. That’s important because computers today are pretty dumb! They don’t know anything unless someone tells them. By learning how the human brain works, we can make computers do things that we never thought possible. Like play games, or solve puzzles, or even answer questions! That’d be cool! Wouldn’t it? That’ll take a lot of work, but I hope you get the idea. Science is fun! And sometimes it teaches us things that change our whole lives! Yay! Science rules!!! :-) :) :) :) :-) :-).) :) :) ::::::::.:) :) ::) ::):)))))))))))))))))))"
"When an embryo is developing , stem cells must divide and develop into many specialized types of cells . However , if cell division doesn't stop , or if it restarts later in life , it can cause tumors to form . Musashi-1 is a protein that binds to molecules of RNA and helps to promote cell growth during development: mice that lack this protein have serious brain defects and die shortly after birth . Musashi-1 is usually turned off in adult cells that are not dividing . Sometimes , however , it remains active and contributes to the growth of cancers in the brain and the gut . Reducing Musashi-1 levels in colon tumors slows their growth and causes the cancer cells to die . To find a compound that would switch off Musashi-1 , Clingman et al . screened more than 30 , 000 compounds and identified four inhibitors . One of these was oleic acid , a fatty acid that is found in olive oil and other animal and plant oils . Oleic acid interacts with Musashi-1 in a way that changes the shape of the protein . These changes mean that Musashi-1 is no longer able to regulate the genes that control cell proliferation . Clingman et al . also found that Musashi-1 promotes the activity of a particular enzyme that makes fatty acids; molecules that are needed in large quantities when cells are dividing . Musashi-1 appears to act as a ‘nutrient sensor’ , turning down the activity of this enzyme in cells when levels of oleic acid are high , and turning up enzyme activity when oleic acid levels are low . The findings of Clingman et al . further reveal how our diets can affect gene expression , and may aid the development of new treatments against cancer ."," Researchers have discovered that a certain protein called Musashi 1 (MSI1) plays a crucial role in helping cells grow properly. MSI 1 helps cells become what they need to be, like becoming a muscle cell or a nerve cell. Scientists know that MSI-1 works best when the cells have enough energy to do what they are supposed to do. Now scientists have learned that a special kind of sugar molecule called oleate stops MSI from doing its job. Oleate is usually made in the lab by adding chemicals to coconut oil. So far, scientists think that oleates might stop cells from growing into muscles or nerves. More research needs to be done to find out exactly how oleats keep MSI molecules from working. But knowing about oleases gives scientists a good starting point to figure out ways to fix problems with cells that don't work right. That knowledge could lead to better medicines to cure diseases like muscular dystrophy. The research shows that sometimes things happen because of chemical reactions happening in our bodies. Sometimes those reactions can go wrong and cause bad things to happen. By learning about those reactions, scientists can come up with ideas to fix them. That makes everyone healthier.

"Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . The arrival of an electrical signal called an action potential at the first neuron triggers the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse . These chemicals then diffuse across the gap between the neurons and bind to receptors on the second cell . The neurotransmitter molecules are stored in the first cell in packages known as vesicles , which release their contents by fusing with the cell membrane . Following a fusion event , neurons must replenish their vesicle stocks to ensure that they are ready for the arrival of the next action potential . This replenishment process is known to involve a calcium-dependent pathway and a calcium-independent pathway . A protein called calmodulin , that binds calcium ions , has an important role in the first of these pathways . Now , Liu et al . have shown that another protein , synaptotagmin 7 , also has a key role in the replenishment of synaptic vesicles , possibly as a sensor for calcium ions . Moreover , Liu et al . found that synaptotagmin 7 and calmodulin bind to each other to form a complex , which suggests that the calcium-dependent replenishment pathway is regulated by this complex . The synaptotagmins are a family of 17 proteins , three of which are present in all animals . Two of these were known to have roles in synapses , but the role of the third—synaptotagmin 7—had been unclear . In addition to providing a more complete understanding of the replenishment of synaptic vesicles , the work of Liu et al . also supplies the final piece of the jigsaw regarding the role of the synaptotagmins that are present in all animals ."," Synaptotagnin 7 helps make sure that chemicals get sent correctly between brain cells. There are three types of synapto tagmins, and scientists know that synaptotangin 1 and 2 play roles in making sure chemicals get delivered properly when brain cells talk to each other. But now, researchers have learned that synpatotagin 8 does something else. It makes sure that brain cells can send more chemicals to each once they have already talked to each others. This happens through a process called refilling. If there isn't enough synaptogamin 7, brain cells don't communicate very well. Also, if you stop the refilling process, brain cell communication stops working. So, it seems like synaptoganin 6 helps brain cells communicate with each others, and synaptognanin 4 helps make more of those chemicals ready to be sent. All of these things happen really quickly, so scientists had to use special ways of watching brain cells to figure this out. They think that synoptotagmine 7 works with another protein called calmodlin to make sure brain cells refill their chemicals. And they think that both of these chemicals have to touch each other to make this happen. Finally, they figured out that synpoptotaganin 3 doesn't seem to work with calmodin, but still helps brain cell talk to one another. That means that there might be other ways that brain cell make sure they can talk to other brain cells besides just touching each other! Scientists aren't sure why synaptotonin 5 doesn' t seem to help brain cells talking to eachother. Maybe it doesn' 't fit in right? Or maybe it does something different? Whatever it does, it must be pretty important because without it, animals wouldn''be alive today! Scientist think that figuring out exactly what each of these parts do will help them learn more about diseases like autism and schizophrenia."
"People may experience a stressful or traumatic event that can cause anxiety in their day-to-day lives . For some people , this anxiety can persist and develop into a disorder , such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or acute stress disorder . Millions of people worldwide suffer from these disorders , but there are few classes of drug treatments currently available . Some preliminary studies in mice have suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs called cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors may relieve symptoms of anxiety . COX-2 inhibitors target an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 , which is produced in many tissues throughout the body and brain . Some COX-2 inhibitors , such as Celebrex , are already widely used to treat arthritis . Studies in people have also suggested these drugs given in combination with antidepressants might also help people with depression , while a recently developed COX-2 inhibitor , called LM-4131 , stops the breakdown of chemicals produced in the brain that interact with the same brain receptors that marijuana does . In animal studies , this new drug reduced anxious behaviors . However , scientists didn’t know if the drug would also reduce anxious behaviors after animals were exposed to a traumatic or stressful experience . Now , Gamble-George et al . – including some of the same scientists that created LM-4131 – show this drug does reduce anxious behavior in mice after a traumatic or stressful experience . In the experiments , mice were stressed with an electric shock to their feet and then treated with LM-4131 , Celebrex , another COX-2 inhibitor sometimes used in humans , or an inactive control . The mice were then placed in new environments or mazes high off the ground that usually trigger anxious behavior . The mice treated with any of the three COX-2 inhibitors were less likely to act like they were anxious than the mice treated with the control solution . Gamble-George et al . then showed that LM-4131 changes how cells in the brain become excited in both isolated mouse brain cells and live mice . Short-term stress in humans is known to excite cells in an area of the brain called the amygdala , which controls how we respond to stress or trauma . The experiments showed that LM-4131 decreases this activity and decreases anxiety in stressed mice . Future animal and human studies are needed to confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a useful treatment for stress disorders , and learn more about how they work .","Stressful events can cause mood and anxiety problems. Some scientists think that taking certain painkillers might help treat these issues. There are different kinds of painkillerm that block the way chemicals work inside the body. One kind of painkiller blocks the way another set of chemicals works. Another kind of drug stops just one chemical from doing its job. New painkillerr that only block one particular chemical seem to work really well. They are safe enough to try on people who already have mood and/ or anxiety problems caused by being stressed. So far, these new painkillere seem to calm down people's feelings pretty well. It seems that these new drugs might be good choices for treating mood and / or anxiety issues. More research will need to be done before doctors know for sure that these drugs are safe and effective ways to treat people with mood and anxiousness problems. For now, it looks like these new medications might be helpful for people who feel sad or nervous because of things that happened to them. If you want to learn more about these medicines, talk to your doctor. Together, you can decide if trying them would be a good idea for you. If your doctor thinks it is okay for you to take these drugs, make sure to follow his or her advice about when and how often to take them. Doing this should help you figure out if these pills would be good options for you and your situation. If they are, great! But if they aren't, then maybe you can ask your doctor to recommend other options that might work better for you instead. Good luck! And remember, you're not alone. People care about you and want to help you feel better. That includes us too! We hope everything turns out okay foryou. Take care! 😞💗. 𝓚𝔼. ✋"
"Surrounding every living cell is a biological membrane that is largely impermeable to water-soluble molecules . This hydrophobic ( or “water-hating” ) barrier preserves the contents of the cell and also regulates how the cell interacts with its environment . This latter function is critical and relies on a class of proteins that are embedded within the membrane and are also hydrophobic . The hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins is however inconvenient for biochemical studies which usually take place in water-based solutions . Therefore , membrane proteins are under-represented in biological research compared to the water-soluble ones , even though roughly one quarter of a cell’s proteins are membrane proteins . Researchers have developed a few tricks to keep membrane proteins soluble after they have been extracted from the membrane . An old but popular technique makes use of detergents , which are chemicals with opposing hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties ( hydrophilic literally means “water-loving” ) . However , even mild detergents can damage membrane proteins and will sometimes lead to experimental artifacts . More recent tricks to stabilize membrane proteins without detergents have been described but remain laborious , costly or difficult to perform . To overcome these limitations , Carlson et al . developed a simple method to stabilize membrane proteins without detergent . Called the “peptidisc” , the method uses multiple copies of a unique peptide – a short sequence of the building blocks of protein – that had been redesigned to have optimal hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties . The idea was that the peptides would wrap around the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein , and shield them from the watery solution . Indeed , when Carlson et al . mixed this peptide with five different membrane proteins from bacteria , all were perfectly soluble and functional without detergent . The ideal ratio of peptide needed to form a peptidisc around each membrane protein was reached automatically , without having to test many different conditions . This indicates that the peptidisc acts like a “one size fits all” scaffold . The peptidisc is a new tool that will allow more researchers , including those who are not expert biochemists , to study membrane proteins . This will yield a better understanding of the structure of a cell’s membrane and how it interacts with the environment . Since the approach is both simple and easy to apply , more membrane proteins can now also be included in high-throughput searches for potential new drugs for various medical conditions ."," Membranes are made up of fatty layers surrounding cells, and some chemicals need to cross those membranes to get where they're going. But sometimes those chemicals are very delicate, and if you try to move them across the membranes, they break apart. So researchers came up with ways to make ""nanodiscs"" that hold the chemicals safely while they cross the membrances. But those nanodisks require lots of pieces that fit together perfectly, and they take a long time to make. Researchers wanted faster, easier ways to keep the chemicals safe while crossing the membrance, so they came up the ""peptidics"". They found that if they added a special kind of protein to the mix, the proteinstayed together really well and protected the chemicals while they crossed the membranse. And because the peoptidisc uses one kind of special protein, it works quickly and easily. That way, researchers can study more kinds of chemicals without having to wait forever to make the right nanodisco. It's like having a bunch of Lego sets that come in different colors, shapes, and sizes, and then someone else already put all the pieces together for you before you even got your Legos! All you have to do is pick the box that looks most interesting to you and start playing with it right away. That's what the pepto disc does for the chemiclas! And now researchers can focus on studying the cool things the chemiclases do, rather than figuring out how to get them to do those things in the first place. Cool! Science is awesome! Yay science! Pass the duct tape please, my pants are falling down. (Editor's note: We apologize if the above summary seemed incoherent.

"Most cells contain molecules of DNA that carry instructions to make the proteins cells need to perform different tasks . When a cell requires a certain protein , the corresponding DNA sequence is first transcribed into molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) known as transcripts . These sequences of RNA are then read by the cell and translated into the desired protein sequence . Errors in copying DNA before a cell divides , can lead to genetic mutations that affect the ability of the cell to carry out certain roles , influencing the overall ‘fitness’ of the cell . Similar to genetic mutations , errors that arise when forming RNA transcripts may also alter the tasks a cell performs . However , it is difficult to find out what kinds of errors cells have in their transcripts and how often these mistakes occur . This is because current methods for sequencing RNA are prone to technical inaccuracies that interfere with the ability to detect true transcript errors . Now , Li and Lynch have adapted a method for high-throughput sequencing of RNA , which can accurately identify transcript errors in Escherichia coli and other species of bacteria . The experiments showed that errors in RNA molecules occurred more frequently than genetic mutations in the same sequence of DNA . Li and Lynch also found that the transcripts contained more nonsense errors – that is , mutations which prematurely stop transcripts from being translated , resulting in shorter proteins – at the end of the RNA molecule than at the beginning or middle . It is possible that transcripts with errors at the beginning or the middle are more efficiently eliminated than those at the end , suggesting that bacteria have a quality-control mechanism for removing transcripts with premature stop sequences . These findings suggest that at any one-time cells carry thousands of transcripts with inaccuracies in their sequence , which likely impact the tasks cells perform . The next step will be to investigate how these different transcript errors affect the fitness of cells ."," Transcript errors are mistakes that happen when copies of DNA are turned into proteins. Scientists wanted to know how common these mistakes are in bacteria. They used special techniques to look at lots of pieces of DNA from four different types of bacteria. By looking carefully at the kinds of mistakes they saw, they learned even more about how these mistakes might affect things. Mistakes that turn stop signs into other letters can mess up proteins and lead to problems like cancer. Even though scientists don't really think bacteria get cancer, sometimes mistakes like this can hurt them too. Just like in people, mistakes can also help bacteria do better. Sometimes mistakes let them fix themselves so they keep working. Other times mistakes give them new ways to do things. So, just like with people, sometimes getting sick can actually be good for bacteria! Because of this, scientists think that mistakes might be helpful for making sure bacteria stay alive. But because they haven't seen all the mistakes that can happen, they need to keep looking to learn more. That way, maybe someday they will find even more ways to use mistakes to help bacteria live better. And who knows? Maybe they will even figure out ways to make people feel better too! Just like with medicine, science is always moving forward little bit at a time. It takes a lot of hard work to put all the pieces together, but in the end, everyone learns something new!

"The loss of a limb will have a profound impact on an individual’s daily life . Nevertheless , individuals can employ a variety of behavioural strategies to adapt to the loss of , say , a hand . Some become skilled at using the residual part of their arm , while others prefer to rely on their other hand . Their brain , too , will undergo major changes . Many studies have shown that the region of the brain that controlled a given limb can be “taken over” by another part of the body if that limb is lost . This process has been previously considered to be harmful , as it has been linked to experiences of pain arising from the missing limb . Now , Makin et al . have explored the links between changes in the behaviour of individuals missing a hand and changes in their brains . People who had been born without a hand or who had lost a hand in later life were asked to wear a device that recorded their movements as they went about their daily lives . The data revealed that people who had been born without a hand made relatively more use of their residual limb , while those who had lost their hand made relatively more use of their remaining hand . Moreover , these differences were reflected in patterns of brain activity . In the subjects born without a hand ( who were making relatively extensive use of their residual limb ) , the area of the brain that would otherwise control the ‘missing’ hand was activated when the subjects moved their residual limb . And in the subjects who had lost their hand , this brain region was activated when they moved their remaining hand . However , in individual subjects , the size of the effect depended on the usage preferences of the subject: for example , the minority of people who were born without a hand but nevertheless make extensive use of their intact hand showed a pattern of activation that resembled the average pattern seen in those who had lost a hand in later life . By providing new insights into the plasticity of brain and behaviour following the loss of a hand , the work of Makin et al . may aid the development of rehabilitation techniques to help patients to optimise the use of both their residual and their intact limbs ."," Researchers wanted to know how losing a limb affects the brain. They looked at how much people used their remaining arms and legs after losing a hand or foot. They also looked at whether people preferred to use their dominant hand before losing it. They then saw how the brain responded when people moved their remaining hand or leg. They found that people who relied more on moving their remaining arm also used their arm more. They concluded that how we use our bodies helps our brains stay strong and work properly. This finding could help doctors develop better treatment plans for people who lost a limp. It could also help scientists learn more about how the human body works. That could help us understand diseases that cause parts of our bodies to stop working correctly. It might also teach us how to prevent those things from happening. If we can figure out how to keep our bodies strong and healthy, we might live longer and healthier lives. That would be great news! Scientists already know a lot about how our brains change when we lose a limbs. But they didn't really know how much our brains changed if we used our remaining limbs differently. Now they do!

"For many aquatic creatures , the red blood cells that rush through their bodies are created in organs such as the liver or the kidney . In most land vertebrates however , blood-cell production occurs in the bone marrow . There , the process is shielded from the ultraviolet light or starker temperature changes experienced out of the water . It is possible that this difference evolved long before the first animal with a backbone crawled out of the aquatic environment and faced new , harsher conditions: yet very little fossil evidence exists to support this idea . A definitive answer demands a close examination of fossils from the water-to-land transition including lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . To support the production of red blood cells , their fin and limb bones would have needed an internal cavity that can house a specific niche that opens onto a complex network of blood vessels . To investigate this question , Estefa et al . harnessed the powerful x-ray beam produced by the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and imaged the fin and limb bones from fossil lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . The resulting three-dimensional structures revealed spongy long bones with closed internal cavities where the bone marrow cells were probably entrapped . These could not have housed the blood vessels needed to create an environment that produces red blood cells . In fact , the earliest four-legged land animals Estefa et al . found with an open marrow cavity lived 60 million years after vertebrates had first emerged from the aquatic environment , suggesting that blood cells only began to be created in bone marrow after the water-to-land transition . Future work could help to pinpoint exactly when the change in blood cell production occurred , helping researchers to identify the environmental and biological factors that drove this change ."," Researchers looked closely at the bones of ancient creatures to learn about how bones make blood cells. Some animals, like fish, don't have blood cells made in their bones. Other animals, including humans, do. Scientists think that making blood cells in bones happened before animals lived on land. But no one really knew when this started happening. To find out, researchers looked at bones from different kinds of animals that lived a very, very, VERY, VVERY, VERRRRYYYY long time ago. By looking at the way the bones were made, the researchers learned that some of those old animals already had blood cells being made in them! That means that some animals were able to make blood in their own bones before they lived on dry land. So, the scientists think that blood cells were made in bones a LONG time before animals came to live on land!"". ""Scientists look at bones to see how they grew. They saw that some bones had holes in them. Those holes helped make blood. Then, the scientist thought about another thing they had learned. They had learned that fish do NOT make blood inside their bones! Instead, fish make blood somewhere else in their bodies and then the blood moves into the bones. So the scientists thought that maybe, long, long ago, before anyone ever lived on the land, some animals also made blood somewhere ELSE in their body and then moved it into their bones."". ""Researchers looked at the insides of bones from very old animals to figure out how the bones worked. They found that some parts of the bones had spaces in them that looked like they were meant to hold blood cells! That meant that some early animals probably made blood cells inside their own bone marrows just like modern animals do! And since those early animals didn't live on the beach or in the ocean, it looks like making blood in bones happens WAY before animals decided to move from the water to the land!"""
"The connection between stress and alcohol use is highly complex . On one hand , there is the idea of having a drink to ‘steady the nerves’ . On the other hand , in alcoholics , abnormal responses to stress often accompany heavy drinking . In this case , it remains unknown whether stress cause excessive drinking , or vice versa . Areas of the brain that normally help respond to stress work differently in long-term , heavy drinkers . One example is a structure called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) , which is over-active in anxiety disorders and is also associated with some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal . The mechanism behind both problems is thought to be a specific ‘signaling system’ that is activated by a small molecule called dynorphin . Previous research into the effects of dynorphin was performed either in the context of alcoholism or of anxiety disorders , but it was not known if there was a connection between the two . Therefore , Hwa et al . wanted to determine how prolonged alcohol use might affect responses to stress , and whether dynorphin signaling plays a role . To model long-term alcohol use in the laboratory , a group of mice was given free access to alcohol every other day , ensuring that they developed the mouse equivalent of a drinking habit . After six weeks , these ‘heavy drinkers’ went through a period of abstinence , mimicking alcohol withdrawal . Then , the mice were stressed by exposing them to a chemical that smelled like a fox , one of the mice’s predators in the wild . When mice smell predators , they normally respond by fleeing from the area and digging up debris to defend itself . As expected , the control mice in this study , which did not drink alcohol , did just that . In contrast , the heavy drinkers largely ignored the predator scent by not digging and even spent time hanging around the area that smelled like the predator . Blocking dynorphin-induced signaling in the alcoholic mice , either using a drug or by deleting the gene that codes for dynorphin , reset the stress response to normal , allowing these mice to avoid the predator and dig as normal . Furthermore , measuring the electrical activity in the brain revealed that the BNST was abnormally active in alcohol-drinking mice , driven by signals from another part of the brain , the prefrontal cortex . This reveals part of the circuitry in the brain responsible for the connection between alcohol withdrawal and the stress response . These results shed new light on the biological mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alcohol use and stress . In the future , these could be used to determine why heavy drinking can overlap with anxiety disorders , or to develop new treatments that would help recovering alcoholics cope better with stress ."," Alcohol consumption can affect how your body responds to stressful situations. To study this, researchers exposed mice to a chemical that smells like a predator animal. They found that mice who had drunk a lot of alcohol responded differently to the smell than mice without any history of drinking. When the mices' brains were examined, there were changes in some parts of the mouses' brains that made them respond to the chemical. Deleting certain chemicals in the part of brain called the bed nuce of the striatum (BNST) prevented the mouse from responding to the predator chemical. Chemicals that block a type of chemical signal called kappa-opioid helped reduce the mises' reaction to the stressful situation. This shows that the BSNST plays a role and that changing certain chemicals can help reduce the stress response. It is important to know about these changes because they could help find better ways to deal with stress reactions that happen due to drinking too much alcohol. There are already medicines that work like the chemicals that were blocked in the study. Knowing more about how alcohol affects stress responses could help doctors figure out if these kinds of medicines would be helpful for someone who drinks too much. It could also help scientists learn more about what happens in the body when someone drinks too little or none at all. That could help them come up with better ways of helping people who drink too much to stop. It might also help keep people healthy overall. There is still a lot to learn about how drinking affects stress and how to fix it. More studies need to be done to see if these results apply to humans. If they do, it could help people who struggle with drinking find better treatment options. It would also give them more information about how their bodies react when they drink too little, just the right amount, or too much, especially when things aren't going well."
"Living cells must be able to withstand changes in the environment . For example , if there is a sudden increase in temperature—which could damage proteins or other molecules—most cells can respond with the ‘heat shock response’ . In humans and other mammals , a single protein called heat shock factor 1 triggers the production of numerous heat shock proteins that protect the cell from the detrimental effects of high temperatures . Most heat shock proteins protect cells by binding to , and stabilizing , other molecules in the cell; this prevents these molecules from being damaged or from aggregating and allows them to continue to function as normal . A protein called eEF1A1 is involved in the final stages of protein production and also enhances the function of heat shock factor 1 during the heat shock response . To make a protein , an enzyme called RNA polymerase transcribes DNA in the nucleus of the cell into a messenger RNA molecule that then exits the nucleus and binds to a ribosome . This molecular machine then translates the messenger RNA sequence into a protein by joining together individual building blocks called amino acids in the correct order . Like other elongation factors , eEF1A1 helps to select the amino acids that match the sequence of the messenger RNA template . However , it was unclear how eEF1A1 helped to protect cells during the heat shock response . Nudler et al . have now engineered cells—from humans and mice—that make less of the eEF1A1 protein than normal . These cells had enough of this protein to support their growth and development under normal conditions , but not enough to help during the heat shock response . When these cells are subjected to a sudden increase in temperature , they fail to produce a sufficient amount of major heat shock proteins . Heat shock factor 1 is needed to transcribe the genes that encode these heat shock proteins , and Nudler et al . found that eEF1A1 must bind to heat shock factor 1 and then to a moving RNA polymerase for these genes to be transcribed efficiently . Moreover , the eEF1A1 protein was shown to bind to and stabilize the heat shock proteins' messenger RNAs , and aid their export from the nucleus and their binding to the ribosome . These newly discovered roles for eEF1A1 during the heat shock response highlight this elongation factor as a promising drug target for treating diseases where protein folding goes awry , for example in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease . In adults , neurons do not make enough eEF1A1 , and Nudler et al . suggest that enabling these cells to make more of this protein could help to treat a range of neurodegenerative conditions ."," During times of stress, like exposure to extreme temperatures, living cells react by producing special proteins called chaperones. Chaperones help keep other proteots from misfolding and causing damage. In order to make chaperone proteins quickly during a temperature change, cells need to prepare ahead of time by making extra copies of the genes that code for them. This preparation happens because of something called the “Heat Shock Response” ( HRR ). Scientists know that a protein named eEFla1 helps carry out the first steps of the HRR. In this article, scientists studied what else eEFLa1 does during the HSR. They found out that eEFa1 helps get rid of unwanted copies of chaperon genes after the stress is gone! They also figured out that there is another version of eefla that doesn't seem to play a part in the HRS. Because of this discovery, researchers now think that maybe they could use drugs to block eEFai from helping cells deal with stress. That could open up new ways to treat diseases related to stress and heat. For example, blocking eEFia1 could stop cancer cells from growing and spreading. Or it could help people who suffer from Parkinson's disease, since that disease makes people feel too hot sometimes. There are still lots of questions about exactly how eEFlia works during the Heat Shock Responses, though. For instance, we don't really know yet how eefila finds the genes it helps copy. Figuring out the answers to those questions could teach us even more about how to fight off diseases that involve heat and stress. Good luck reading!

"Plants form new structures such as flowers or branches throughout their life as they develop and grow . However , most plant cells are not able to produce a new flower or branch because the genes involved in these processes are usually switched off . The genes are found in regions of chromatin—the structure in which DNA is packaged in plant cells—that are normally tightly packed . This packing prevents other proteins called transcription factors from accessing the DNA and switching the genes on . New flowers form from cells that contain high levels of a plant hormone called auxin . In these cells , a protein called MONOPTEROS switches on genes involved in making flowers . How the structure of the chromatin that surrounds these genes is altered so that they can be switched on is not clear . Wu , Yamaguchi , Xiao et al . studied this question in a plant known as Arabidopsis . The experiments show that MONOPTEROS plays a crucial role in altering the structure of chromatin to allow flowers to form . In the presence of high levels of auxin , MONOPTEROS recruits groups of proteins called SWI/SNF remodeling complexes to regions of chromatin that contain genes involved in flower formation . These protein complexes loosen the structure of the chromatin so that genes can be switched on by transcription factors . Wu , Yamaguchi , Xiao et al . 's findings suggest that auxin , with the help of MONOPTEROS and the SWI/SNF remodeling complexes , enables flower formation by changing the chromatin state . They further suggest that this chromatin state switch is also involved in leaf formation and other processes in plants that are controlled by MONOPTEROS and auxin ."," Plants use tiny chemicals called hormones to tell their cells what to do. Some hormones like auxin tell cells where to move, while others tell them when to grow. Researchers wanted to know how plants decide which cells get to hear the message from auxin. When auxin arrives at a cell, it gets taken up by special proteins called receptors. Inside the cell, the receptor meets up with other proteins to activate a chemical reaction. If the cell is going to move because of auxins signal, then it needs to change its chemistry too. To do this, the cell uses something called a “switch” to flip its chemistry. The researchers discovered that auxin makes a protein named MP work together with other enzymes to flip the cell’s switch. Without MP, the switch doesn’t flip and the cell doesn’s move. The authors found that auxins signals can only work when MP is present. So, without MP, no matter how much auxin there is, cells don’t respond. The team also figured out that MP works together with auxin receptos to activate the switch. Finally, the researchers tested whether MP really did work as a switch. They found that MP worked best when it was attached to the place in the cell where the auxin signal started. That way, the cells responded quickly to the auxins message. Overall, the study shows that MP is a very good candidate for being a switch that lets cells react to auxins messages. It also explains why auxin signals need MP to work properly. The results also explain how auxin tells cells exactly where to go. The discovery of MP as a key player in auxin signalling opens the door to understanding how plants use auxin to control their growth and development. This knowledge could help us understand how to make better crops. For example, we could learn how to keep unwanted plants from growing in places where they shouldn’t be, such as cracks in sidewalks. Or maybe we could figure out how to get plants to grow faster or bigger."
"Stem cells in the bone marrow are essential for creating new blood cells . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) is a common type of blood cancer in the elderly that occurs when blood cells fail to develop normally . Depending on which types of blood cells are affected , individuals with MDS may bleed more easily , feel weak and tired , or be unable to effectively fight off infections . Animals and plants store their genetic information in the form of chromosomes . Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes , with one copy inherited from the mother , and the other from the father . The bone marrow cells of many people with MDS delete a section from one of their copies of chromosome 7 . As this section contains many different genes , it is difficult to fully understand which specific genes contribute to the development of MDS when one copy is lost . Wong et al . have now genetically engineered mice to lack a section of one of their copies of chromosome 7 that is often missing in patients with MDS . Bone marrow cells from these mice exhibit many of the same abnormalities found in human MDS . For example , most of the immature blood stem cells expand , but these stem cells do not correctly specialize into mature blood cells—in particular , not enough immune cells are produced . The developing blood cells also have problems expressing several genes , including one that helps to protect the cells from damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species . These problems worsen as the mice age . These mice provide the first evidence directly linking the missing section of chromosome 7 to abnormalities found in MDS patients . Future studies using the mice will advance our understanding of how the loss of this section of chromosome 7 interacts with other genes involved in MDS to alter the course of this disease and how it responds to treatment ."," Myelodystrophy Syndrome (MDS) is a blood disorder where the bone marrow makes too few healthy red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells. One way that MDS happens is through missing pieces of certain parts of our DNA, called ""chromosomes"". Some types of M DS involve missing pieces from chromosomes number seven and eight. Researchers wanted to learn more about why having a piece of chromsome seven missing might cause problems. They found that mice whose cells had a missing piece of a part of chromsoome seven behaved like cells from people with MDS. For example, the researchers saw that the missing piece caused problems with making new blood cells and keeping them alive. They also saw that having a missing chromosme seven piece made the problem worse when combined with another change to the cells. The researchers think that having the missing chromsomoe seven piece might make it harder for the body to get enough oxygen, since the cells didn't work right. They hope that finding out more about how the missing pieces cause problems will help us find ways to fix them and better treat MDS.""""This study provides strong genetic evidence supporting the hypothesis that haplosufficiency of the 7 q 22 region contributes to M DS pathophysiology. The authors show that a ∼2 Mb deletion in the same region that is frequently observed in human MDS confers a MDS phenotype in m ice. Furthermore, the authors show additive effects of the deletion with GATA2 h aploins sufficiency, suggesting that the GATA1 and GATA 2 genes in this region act in concert to maintain proper hemat opoiesis. This study represents an important advance in our understanding of the molecular basis of M DS and should stimulate efforts to evaluate the therapeutic potential of correcting this deletion."""
"In the nervous system , a network of specialized neurons—known as the somatosensory system—carries information about sensations including touch , muscle position , temperature and pain . Distinct sets of somatosensory neurons are thought to carry information about the different types of sensations . In young animals , the precise switching on , or ‘expression’ , of genes controls the formation of the network of neurons . However , it is not known exactly which genes are expressed in what types of neurons , where , or when . Here , Chiu et al . used a technique called flow cytometry using different fluorescent markers to isolate a group of cells called Dorsal Root Ganglion ( DRG ) neurons in mice . These neurons have long thread-like fibers that extend from the spinal cord to the skin , muscles and joints all over the body . These fibers carry sensory information to the spinal cord , where it can be relayed to the brain and processed . The experiments compared three distinct types of DRG neuron and found that they differed in their ability to send information to other cells . Chiu et al . analyzed the expression of all the genes in the three types of DRG neurons . Each type of neuron had distinct groups of genes that were being expressed . Also , several genes that are known to be important for sensation were expressed at different levels in the different types of cells . Next , large numbers of single cells were analyzed to find out the finer details about the three types of neuron . These findings made it possible to further divide the DRG neurons into six distinct subsets that matched previously known groups of somatosensory neurons , and also identified new ones . Chiu et al . 's findings reveal the complexity and diversity of the neurons involved in carrying information about sensations towards the brain . This is an important step in classifying the nervous system , and uncovers many genes previously not linked to sensation . The next challenges lie in understanding how the expression of these genes in each type of neuron relates to their unique roles ."," Researchers have learned more about the different kinds of nerve cells in the skin that sense things like touch, temperature, and pain. They did this by looking at how different kinds make proteins. There are three big groups of nerve cell types, and inside each group, there are even smaller groups of cells that seem to be different. But, inside each of these groups, the nerve cells seemed pretty much alike. So, the researchers looked closer at one kind of nerve fiber cell, the ones that feel heat and pressure. They broke them into three groups again, based on how they responded to chemicals. Then, they looked at how each group makes proteins and found that each group had unique combinations of proteins, just like the original three groups. That means that each of the little groups of feeling nerve fibers might actually be totally different kinds! It seems like there are lots more kinds of feeling nerves than anyone thought. Figuring out how all these different kinds fit together will tell us more about how we feel things and how to treat problems with those feelings. That includes things like pain, which we want to reduce, and touch, which is good to keep around. And who knows? Maybe finding out more about these nerve cells will teach us something new about how to feel things ourselves too! That way, we could feel warmer or cooler, or stronger or gentler touches. Just imagine how great that would be! All of this science stuff started because people wanted to know how to fix pain better. Now, it looks like we might find out how to make it never happen in thefirst place! Or maybe even get to choose how wefeel sometimes. Wouldn’t that be awesome?!?

"Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , giving 46 chromosomes in total . When a cell divides , it typically copies all its chromosomes and distributes the copies equally between the two new cells , so that they also have 46 chromosomes . Cells in the reproductive organs undergo a special division process called meiosis , which halves the number of chromosomes . As a result , sperm and eggs have just 23 chromosomes , and so when they combine , the fertilized egg receives a complete set of 46 chromosomes . A similar process happens in all species that use sexual reproduction . As the chromosomes prepare to separate , they line up side by side in matching pairs . During this period , DNA from one chromosome will swap with DNA from its partner . These events are called “crossovers , ” and because such exchanges can happen at many locations along the chromosomes , no two sperm or eggs are the same . Historic studies in fruit flies revealed that chromosomes do not mix their DNA at random . After one crossover occurs , it is less likely that another will happen , and if there are two crossovers , the second one tends be far away from the first . This suggests that there must be a signal that tells the chromosomes about the exchange . However , the nature of the signals and how they are communicated along pairs of chromosomes remain mysterious . A structure called the “synaptonemal complex” holds chromosomes together while they mix their DNA . In 2017 , researchers found that this structure behaves like a liquid crystal: its molecules are organized into a regular , repeating pattern , but they move freely , like a fluid . If signals could move through this material , this might explain how information spreads along paired chromosomes . Now , Zhang et al . – including two researchers involved in the 2017 work – identify some of the signals in the small roundworm , Caenorhabditis elegans , as four related proteins named ZHPs . When tagged with fluorescent markers and followed under a microscope , all four ZHP proteins moved to the liquid crystal-like synaptonemal complex during meiosis . Depleting the proteins at this crucial time revealed their roles . Two of the proteins are needed for chromosomes to mix their DNA , while the other two control the number of exchanges between each pair of chromosomes . Successful meiosis depended upon all four ZHPs , and so too did the fertility of the worms . The next step is to find the other molecules that interact with the ZHP proteins during meiosis . Since similar proteins appear in other species , including humans , this could help to reveal more about how genetic traits from our parents mix and match . In the future , studies that build on these findings could also help scientists to understand how errors in these processes give rise to birth defects and infertility ."," Meiosis is a special type of cell division that allows sexually reproducing organisms to make gametes (eggs and sperm). In order to ensure that eggs and sperms receive half of the genetic material from each parent, a special kind of exchange called ""cross over"" happens between pairs of matching pieces of DNA (called homologues). This cross over needs to happen only once per pair of matched pieces of genetic material. Scientists know that there are proteins that help guide this cross over to happen in the right place, but they don't really know what those proteins do. Now, scientists have learned more about these proteins in worms. They found out that these proteINS are part of something called the ""synaptonema complex"", which is a strange structure that forms between the paired pieces of material. By looking at the worms closely, they saw that these proteinS seem to move around in this structure and then stop in one spot. When they took away parts of these proteINs, they noticed that the cross overs happened in the wrong places. So, these proteIns might help guide the cross over by moving around and stopping in the correct location. This movement might be controlled by another protein called HIM-6. Overall, this study showed us that these weird proteins might help keep track of where the cross oVERs need to happen. This knowledge might help us learn how to fix problems with making eggs and making sperm. That would be really helpful! Because humans make eggs and guys in the same way, we might be able to use this knowledge to help people who have trouble having babies. Or maybe we could use this information to help us figure out ways to make super strong plants! Who knows? Maybe we'll learn even more cool things about these weird worm proteins first! And then we'd know even more about them and how they work in people too!"
"New cells are made when a single cell duplicates its DNA and divides into two cells , distributing the DNA equally between them , in a process called mitosis . The splitting of the two copies of DNA happens through a series of controlled events known as mitotic exit . Previous research has suggested that mitotic exit relies on both the destruction of specific proteins and the removal of tags called phosphate groups from other proteins . Phosphate groups modify how proteins behave and their removal can trigger changes in a protein’s activity . Although protein destruction and phosphate group removal were known to be important to mitotic exit , it was not understood how they are coordinated in the cell to ensure the correct order of events . Holder et al . have used a technique called mass spectrometry to monitor the level of thousands of proteins , and any tags attached to them , during mitotic exit in human cells grown in the laboratory . The experiments revealed that the destruction of a single protein , known as cyclin B , plays a major role in triggering subsequent events . The removal of cyclin B activates enzymes known as phosphatases , which remove phosphate groups from proteins . Phosphatases then act on a wide range of proteins in a specific order that depends on the environment surrounding the phosphate group . This ‘chain’ of phosphatase activity determines the order of events during mitotic exit . The findings of Holder et al . contribute to the basic understanding of how mitotic exit works . Errors in the process can affect the stability of a cell’s genome , contributing to diseases such as cancer . In the future , this may help to identify what goes wrong in these cases and potential avenues for developing treatments .","When cells divide, they need to go through a few steps before dividing completely. One of these steps is called ""exit"" from division. To get out of division, cells need to complete many tasks including splitting their DNA and separating it into daughter cells. They also need to split some of their organelles and put them into the right daughter cell. To accomplish these things, cells use special enzyme systems that work together to carry out these tasks. Some of these systems break down proteins while others remove phosphate groups from proteins. Scientists wanted to know more about how these systems work together. So, they studied how fast these systems worked by comparing how quickly proteins changed during normal cell division versus when the systems were turned off. By doing this, scientists discovered that one system, called APC, works very quickly to turn over proteins needed for cell division. Another system, which removes phosphates from proteINS, works slower. Scientist think that the APC system needs to turnover proteins quickly because if it doesn't, cells won't be able to divide properly. This discovery will help us understand how cells control when they divide. This knowledge could help doctors treat diseases caused by problems with cell division like cancer. It could also help us learn how to stop cells from dividing when we want to, for example, prevent aging. It might even teach us how to make cells divide faster when we need to, say, heal wounds. Overall, learning more about these systems will help scientists figure out how to control cell division, which would be really useful in many situations. For now, scientists need to figure out exactly which proteins are broken down by the ACP system and why. Then, maybe we can learn how we can use this knowledge to control when cells divide. That sounds pretty exciting! If you want to read more about this topic, check out the article below."
"Around 16% of people will experience an episode of major depression at some point in their lives , with symptoms including a loss of motivation , a reduced enjoyment of previously pleasurable activities , and disturbances in sleep and appetite . Multiple genes and environmental factors have been implicated in depression , and one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disorder is exposure to stress . Stress and depression affect many of the same brain regions , most notably the prefrontal cortex—an area that is involved in decision making , problem solving and regulating emotions . Shrestha et al . therefore reasoned that a good way of obtaining insights into the relationship between stress and depression would be to study prefrontal cortex cells that express genes that have been linked to depression . One such gene is Wfs1 . Mutations in this gene cause a rare disorder called Wolfram syndrome , in which affected individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that often include severe depression . Shrestha et al . identified a specific population of cells in the prefrontal cortex that express Wfs1 . When subjected to a stressful event , such as being restrained , mice that had been genetically modified to lack this gene in their prefrontal cortex were more likely to exhibit depression-like behaviors than non-modified mice . The genetically modified mice also released more stress hormones when restrained and produced different amounts of a number of proteins that regulate the growth and signaling of neurons . Shrestha et al . propose that these proteins act on neural circuits that control how the mice respond to stress . Furthermore , changes in the levels or the distribution of these proteins may increase the likelihood that a stressful event will trigger behaviors associated with depression . Further experiments are required to investigate the possibility that using drugs to manipulate cells that express Wfs1 could protect against the harmful effects of stress , or even treat existing episodes of depression ."," Depression is a very common illness that affects many people all over the world. There are several ways to treat depression, but sometimes these methods aren't enough. That's why scientists continue to search for new ways to cure depression. They recently discovered that some genetic problems can cause depression. These researchers wanted to find out exactly which type of cells in a certain part of your brain called “medial prefontal cortext” (mPFC) play a role in causing depression. First, they made sure that the mPFc cells would respond to stressful situations. Then, they looked at how these cells behaved when stressed and when depressed. Finally, they checked how much of a special kind of protein called “neuropeptides” (NPs) were being made in these brain cells. They did this by looking at how much NPs were actually being made inside the cells (by counting the amount of NPs), and how much was left over (by weighing the leftover NPs). After doing all these steps, they saw that the cells in mPFcs of people who had depression made less NPs than usual. Based on this discovery, they think that these cells might be responsible for making people feel sad when they experience stress. Since depression is usually caused by stress, fixing the way these cells work might help treat depression. This could be done by helping these cells make more NPs, which could be accomplished by taking medicine or getting surgery. Even though this study didn't involve actual people, it gives us a better understanding of how depression happens and helps us figure out ways to prevent it. This knowledge could eventually let doctors develop new medicines or procedures to help people with depression. So, even though we still have a lot to learn about depression, this study took us one step closer to curing it! And that brings us to the next section..."
"Proteins play a wide variety of roles in the cell and interact with many other molecules . The behavior of proteins depends on their structure; yet , proteins are often flexible and will change shape , much like a tree in the wind . Nevertheless , for some of the activities that it performs , a protein must adopt one specific shape . Therefore , the likelihood that the protein will take on this specific shape directly determines how efficiently that protein can perform a specific job . The shape of a protein can be regulated by changes at several levels; these could include modifying one of the amino acid building blocks that make up that protein , binding to another protein , or by placing the protein in a part of the cell that is crowded with other large molecules . Schmid and Hugel wanted to understand how these three different types of regulation affect the structure of a protein and how they relate to its activities . The protein Hsp90 was used as a test case . It typically exists with two copies of the protein bound together , either in a parallel or a V-shape . Hsp90 plays several important roles in metabolism and can break down molecules of ATP , the so-called energy currency of the cell . All three types of regulation favored the Hsp90 pairs taking the parallel structure and increased its breakdown of ATP . The results suggest that the Hsp90 pair has a flexible structure , and that reducing this flexibility can improve Hsp90’s efficiency in carrying out its role . It was particularly unexpected that the large-scale , unspecific effect of placing the protein in a crowded environment could have such similar results to a small-scale , precise change of a single amino acid within the protein . While all three forms of regulation help to stabilize the parallel structure for Hsp90 , they do this through different mechanisms , which influence the speed and the way that the protein transitions between the two structures . Schmid and Hugel believe that these results offer a new perspective on how diversely the shape and function of proteins is controlled at the molecular level , which could have wider implications for medical diagnostics and treatment ."," Scientists studied how the shape of a special kind of protein called Hsp 90 changes when it interacts with another protein called p23. They looked at how the shapes changed using something called Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). To do this, they put tiny pieces of colored lights inside the HSP 9 0 proteins. Then they shined light on the colored pieces and watched how the colors changed. If the colors didn’t change very much, then the pieces of protein weren’t moving very much. If they changed a lot, then scientists knew the pieces were moving a lot. They found that adding a chemical called A557I made the HSp 9 o pieces move a lot more. Adding another chemical called Polymeric Branched Sucrose made them move a bit less. Finally, they added yet another chemical, called monomer Sucroses, which made the pieces move about the same amount as when nothing was added at all! So, sometimes adding chemicals can make things move faster, and sometimes they can make them move slower. But sometimes, adding chemicals doesn’t really change anything at all. That means that sometimes you need to add a certain chemical to get the right result, and other times you need a different chemical to achieve the opposite result. Sometimes, adding a third chemical can cancel out the first chemical’s effect entirely. This is like mixing salt and pepper together. Even though you add salt, the taste won’t be salty anymore because you added pepper too. The researchers think that this might happen inside the cells of living organisms too. They think that adding certain chemicals to cells might change how the proteins work, but adding others might change them back again. And sometimes, mixing certain chemicals together might stop them from changing altogether! That’s pretty cool! It means that we can use chemicals to make proteINS do exactly what we want them to do. That would be super useful for doctors who want to treat diseases caused by bad proteins doing bad things in our bodies. Doctors could give patients special chemicals to fix the problems!"
"The cells of fungi and other eukaryotic organisms are generally asymmetric in shape and structure . This is possible because newly-formed cells can establish front and back ends that influence how each cell grows and develops . A protein called Cdc42 – which can cycle between an active and inactive form – establishes this cell “polarity” . The front of the cell is specified by the accumulation of active Cdc42 proteins in a small area of the membrane that surrounds the cell . However , it is not clear why the accumulation of active Cdc42 only happens in one place . Budding yeast is widely used as a model to study cell polarity . This yeast reproduces through the budding of new daughter cells out of one end of the mother cell . To achieve this , the mother establishes a single front end through the accumulation of active Cdc42 . This marks the site where the daughter cell will emerge . Previous research has shown that during the early stages of cell polarization , Cdc42 clusters start to form at several places on the inner surface of the membrane . Only a single cluster emerges as the winner , while the others lose and shrink away . How does this happen ? One possibility is that Cdc42 clusters all compete with each other to attract polarity proteins from the cell interior , so that when a protein falls off one cluster it can be picked up by another . Another possibility is that the winning cluster acquires a factor that stabilizes it , while the other clusters do not . Here , Wu et al . use microscopy and mathematical modelling to distinguish between these two possible scenarios in budding yeast . The experiments show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering how quickly key polarity proteins move between the membrane and the interior of the cell . Cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make several buds at the same time . Wu et al . ’s findings suggest that the formation of a single front in budding yeast is due to competition for polarity factors . The next challenge will be to understand how some cells in animals and other fungi manage to suppress this competition in order to produce more than one front .","When cells divide, they must split open and break apart from each other. This process happens thanks to a special part of the membrane called the bud scar. A molecule called Bem helps build up this bud scar, so that cells can eventually split apart. Without Bem, cells fail to divide properly. Researchers wanted to understand why cells don't just keep building up extra Bem everywhere, but instead only put it in one place. They discovered that little bits of Bems sometimes pop up all around the inside of the cells. If those little patches of Beme got bigger really quickly, they would take over the whole cell. But because they tend to grow slowly, other places in the cell can catch up and take over instead. So, the best way for one spot to win is to grow faster than others. That way, it can 'eat up' all the Bem before the other spots can. Just like kids competing to eat cookies, the fastest growing spot wins! And just like with kids, if one kid has already eaten lots of cookies, they won't care as much about eating more. Similarly, once a certain amount of BEm has been made, having more doesn't matter anymore. Just as siblings fight over treats, molecules compete to be the most important. Sometimes, though, they need to team up to beat other molecules. Just imagine what would happen if all the kids decided to only eat one kind of cookie - chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin? Yuck! The same thing happens in cells. There are molecules that help build up the bud scars, and ones that help the cells divide. Those molecules need to work together to get the job done right. But if they worked against each other, the cells wouldn't know where to make the budscar, and they couldn't divide properly! Just like sharing is good for families, it's good for cells too. Sharing helps cells figure out where to grow next."
"The DNA molecules in cells are continuously bombarded with radiation , chemicals and other agents , and it is important for cells to repair the damage caused by these before the process of cell division begins . Most DNA molecules consist of two single strands of DNA that are held together by hydrogen bonds in the familiar double-helix structure . Of the various types of damage that DNA molecules are prone to , double-strand breaks are among the most dangerous because they can lead to cancer if they are not repaired . DNA molecules use four bases—adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine—to store genetic information . In single-stranded DNA these bases are attached to a backbone made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups . A crucial feature of double-stranded DNA is that the sequences of bases in the two strands are complementary to each other—adenine is always paired with thymine , and cytosine is always paired with guanine . However , the hydrogen bonds that hold the pairs of bases together are quite weak , which means that the two strands of the double helix can be pulled apart quite easily . The ease with which these bonds can be formed and broken is crucial for many genetic processes . One way to repair a double strand break is to replace the damaged stretch of DNA with an undamaged stretch from another DNA molecule . This process of swapping DNA molecules , which is called strand exchange , is catalyzed by a protein that is able to interact with two DNA molecules at the same time . An important first step within this process is identifying the stretch of DNA that can be used to repair the break . Ragunathan et al . now report evidence from experiments on Escherichia coli that support a model in which the protein catalyst ( RecA in the case of E . coli ) combines with a single strand of DNA to form a filamentous DNA–protein complex ( RecA filament ) that can then slide along a double-stranded DNA molecule to search for a complementary sequence of base pairs . High-resolution fluorescent imaging reveals that the RecA filament is able to sample several hundred base pairs before the filament dissociates from the DNA and rebinds at a different location . The sliding was largely driven by electrostatic interactions between the RecA filament and the double-stranded DNA , and the filament was capable of identifying matching sequences that contained as few as six matching bases . Ragunathan et al . estimate that sliding is about two orders of magnitude faster at finding matching sequences compared to mechanisms that do not involve sliding , such as models that rely solely on chance encounters between DNA molecules and the RecA filament . By showing that a DNA–protein complex can slide along another DNA molecule to search for a target , these results could lead to new insights into other systems in which it is necessary for protein-nucleic acid complexes to locate a particular sequence of bases ."," During certain types of cell division, bacteria called Escherichia coli (E.coli) use special proteins to fix broken pieces of DNA together again. One of these proteinsthat helps join broken DNA fragments is called RecA. Researchers wanted to learn more about how RecA finds the right place to put the broken DNA back together. They used very sensitive equipment to watch tiny bits of DNA move around inside cells. They discovered that RecA moves quickly along one piece of DNA looking for the best spot to meet the second piece of matching DNA. Once RecA meets the second bit of DNA, it slows down and starts searching for the perfect match. If RecA does not find the right match, it lets go of the DNA and keeps moving until it finds another good spot. By doing things this way, RecA can speed up the process of fixing broken DNA. This discovery might help scientists come up with ways to treat illnesses caused by broken DNA like some kinds of cancer. It might also help doctors figure out why people get sick from viruses like HIV and influenza virus. That knowledge could help researchers find ways to fight these diseases. The study was done in cells taken from animals, so it might take a while before anyone knows if it would help humans. But the research gives scientists ideas about how to solve problems that happen when things break apart. Sometimes you can find something that matches the broken pieces exactly. Other times, though, you might have to look for something else that almost goes with the broken parts. And sometimes, you just have to let go and keep trying somewhere else. That’s kind of what happens when RecA looks for places to fix DNA. It’s really amazing how smart little proteins are! Just like us, they have to think about what to do next every day. Even though they live super fast compared to us, it seems like they know when to hurry and when to slow down. That means they probably know when it makes sense to try to fit things together perfectly and when it doesn’t matter as much."
"To produce a protein from a gene , the gene must first be transcribed to make a molecule of RNA . In general , the enzyme building the RNA molecule stops building when it reaches the end of a gene and encounters a termination signal . When a virus replicates , however , it needs to transcribe all the genes in its genome , so it relies on antiterminator proteins to make the enzyme building the RNA ignore the termination signal . Therefore , medicines that stop antiterminators working could stop viral infections spreading . Human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) can cause severe respiratory infections in children , the elderly and people with weakened immune systems . A protein called M2-1 that is found inside HMPV must be present for the virus to infect humans , and it was recently shown that this protein plays a role in antitermination in a virus closely related to HMPV . Using a range of techniques , including X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations , Leyrat et al . worked out the structure of M2-1 in HMPV , and showed that it can flip between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ forms . The open structure presents surfaces that could be targeted by antiviral drugs . When M2-1 binds to RNA , the closed structure is stabilized as a result of the RNA binding to two separate sites on the protein . Leyrat et al . suggest that similar antiterminator proteins in related viruses—including respiratory syncytial virus , Marburg and Ebola—could also bind in this way . Leyrat et al . also propose a model describing how M2-1 can recognize the end of a gene , which could help with the development of new antiviral treatments ."," Scientists have learned about the structure and behavior of a special kind of protein called M2‐1. They did this by studying the protein in detail and then building a computer model based on what they learned. They found that M2‑1 forms long chains of four copies of itself. Some parts of these chains stay together, while others move freely. When the researchers added something called RNA to the mix, the chains broke apart and became smaller. The scientists think that this happens because the RNA helps the chains break down. They also saw that the chains changed shape when they came into contact with RNAs that matched a particular sequence of nucleotides. Finally, the team tested whether the M‐2‐I protein would stick to RNA strands that didn't match the sequence they looked at before. It did! This means that even if you don't know exactly what sequence your body is making, you can tell if there's a chance it matches the wrong one. Understanding how M2 works could help doctors figure out ways to treat viral infections better. For example, they could try to find chemicals that keep M2 from sticking to the wrong RNA. That way, the body wouldn't mistake the wrong thing for the virus, and it could fight off the infection normally. By learning more about M2, scientists hope to find new ways to cure diseases caused by viruses. This study showed that M‐1 proteinstick to RNAthen they should, and that theystick to thewrong oneswhen theydo.This is good news for doctors who want to find cures for viral diseases.By understanding how M‐proteins work, scientists canfind new ways toget rid of them.They can look for things thatstop themfrom doing their jobs.This study helped us understand how M proteinswork.Now we need to find ways to use that knowledge tomake peoplehealthier."
"In cells , worn out proteins and other unnecessary materials are sent to small compartments called lysosomes to be broken down and recycled . Lysosomes contain many different proteins including some that break down waste material into recyclable fragments and others that transport the fragments out of the lysosome . If any of these proteins do not work , waste products build up and cause disease . There are around 70 such lysosomal storage diseases , each arising from a different lysosomal protein not working correctly . A recently developed “nanodevice” called Clensor can measure the levels of chloride ions inside cells . Clensor is constructed from DNA , and its fluorescence changes when it detects chloride ions . Although chloride ions have many biological roles , chloride ion levels had not been measured inside a living organism . Now , Chakraborty et al . – including some of the researchers who developed Clensor – have used this nanodevice to examine chloride ion levels in the lysosomes of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans . This revealed that the lysosomes contain high levels of chloride ions . Furthermore , reducing the amount of chloride in the lysosomes made them worse at breaking down waste . Do lysosomes affected by lysosome storage diseases also contain low levels of chloride ions ? To find out , Chakraborty et al . used Clensor to study C . elegans worms and mouse and human cells whose lysosomes accumulate waste products . In all these cases , the levels of chloride in the diseased lysosomes were much lower than normal . This had a number of effects on how the lysosomes worked , such as reducing the activity of key lysosomal proteins . Chakraborty et al . also found that Clensor can be used to distinguish between different lysosomal storage diseases . This means that in the future , Clensor ( or similar methods that directly measure chloride ion levels in lysosomes ) may be useful not just for research purposes . They may also be valuable for diagnosing lysosomal storage diseases early in infancy that , if left undiagnosed , are fatal ."," Scientists found that there is too much chlorine inside lysossomes in people who have certain diseases. They measured the amount of chlorides in the round parts of the cells called lysssomes. They did this by giving special food to the worms and then measuring the brightness of the worm's color. When the worm ate the special food, the worm had brighter colors. This means that there was more chlorines in the cells. Then, scientists put the worm in water with no special food. After this, the bright color went away. This shows that there were less chlorinated inside the cells. This tells us that the right amount of salt helps the cells work better. Too much salt makes the cells stop working. This happens because the salt keeps the cells from doing things they need. It does this by making the salt stay inside the cell. This stops the cell from letting things go that it needs to let go of. Sometimes, the things that the cell lets go of are things that help the cell break down things that don't work anymore. So, when there is not enough salt inside the laysosomes, the cells can break down broken things. But, when the cells have too much salt inside, the cell cannot break down the broken things. This means the cell doesn't do what it needs. So now we know that the salt helps things happen inside the body, but too much of it can keep things from happening. That is why it is good to eat foods that help you have just the right amounts of salt inside your body. And now we also know that if you feel sick, maybe you should check to see if you have too little or too much sodium inside your cells. Maybe eating something that helps you have the right kind of sodium will make you feel better! Or maybe talking to a doctor might help you figure out what to do so you can feel better."
"Gaze following—working out where someone else is looking , and then switching your attention to that position—is an important part of social behavior and learning . Additionally , it is thought to be an important step towards recognizing that others have a mind of their own . Humans mostly use eye position to work out the ‘gaze direction’ of someone else , whereas non-human primates rely instead on the orientation of the face . However , the neural circuits that control gaze following are thought to be similar in both . Gaze following is a complex process that requires the brain to process a lot of different information . A face must be recognized , and its orientation worked out . A series of complex geometrical calculations must then be performed to work out the direction of the gaze , and how this relates to the position of the observer . Finally , the object of interest needs to be recognized and the attention of the observer focused on it . In the monkey brain , there are six interconnected areas called face patch regions that respond when a monkey is shown a face . However , researchers do not understand how monkeys translate the information about face orientation gathered by these regions into information about where to look during gaze following . Marciniak et al . performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on monkeys to track the flow of blood to different regions of the brain—the higher the blood flow , the more that area of the brain is working . To identify the location of their face patch regions , the monkeys first looked at faces . When the monkeys then performed a gaze following task , a region of the brain close to—but not overlapping—the face patches was activated . Marciniak et al . suggest this is the ‘gaze following patch’ where the brain performs the demanding calculations to translate face orientation into a position to look at . As gaze following is important in social interactions , understanding the neural circuits behind it could help us understand social disorders ."," Monkeys use eye movements to look at objects that others are paying attention to. Now, scientists want to understand how the monkeys’ brain helps them figure out where to look. They already knew that the back of the monkies’ brain has a place called the “superior temporal sulci” (STS) that helps them see faces. They found that there is another spot right next to it that seems to help them figure our where to go next. This spot seemed to get bigger when the monkeys looked at a face and smaller when they looked at something else. Also, the size of this spot depended on how far away the thing was that the monkieys wanted to lookat. Finally, they found that this spot got bigger when monkeys followed someone’s eyes to something rather than just looking at that thing directly. Together, these results mean that the STS and its nearby friend probably help monkeys figure out exactly where to aim their eyes. That way, they can follow along and pay attention just like the rest of us! Scientists think that this knowledge could help doctors fix problems in people who have trouble moving their eyes properly. Maybe they could learn how to help people’s brains work better so that they can move their eyes correctly again! And maybe, eventually, we could learn from monkeys how to keep our own eyes moving smoothly no matter what we’re doing. Yay!

"Amblyopia , otherwise known as ‘lazy eye’ , is a condition in which vision fails to develop normally during childhood , not due to problems with the eye itself but due to problems with the transmission of information from the eye to the brain . It occurs when disorders such as squint—in which the eyes point in different directions—cause the brain to continually ignore input from one eye , with the result that vision in that eye never fully develops . If detected in infancy , amblyopia can be treated by surgery , although such interventions must be performed early because they are much less effective when used on adults . However , Kaneko and Stryker now present data suggesting that the adult mammalian visual system may be more amenable to change than previously thought . Young mice were deprived of visual input to one eye , by having an eyelid sewn shut , during a critical period in the development of their visual systems . When the eye was re-opened at the age of 4–5 months , the mice showed reduced responses in the brain region corresponding to that eye . However , if the mice were then allowed to run on a treadmill for several hours a day while viewing a visual stimulus—either black and white gratings or random noise—the vision in their deprived eye showed a rapid and striking improvement . This improvement was not seen in mice that ran without a visual stimulus , or in mice that looked at the visual stimulus but did not run . Moreover , the improvement was specific to the particular stimulus viewed whilst running . Although the mechanism behind this effect is unclear , it is known that running increases neuronal activity , and one possibility is that neurons that are active simultaneously—such as those encoding the visual stimulus—form stronger connections with one another: ‘neurons that fire together , wire together’ . Further work is required to determine whether similar changes occur in the human visual system and , if they do , whether they could be applied to the treatment of amblyopia ."," When people lose vision in one eye, the remaining eye takes over most of the person's sight. If this remains untreated for a long period of time, however, the good eye eventually loses some of its abilities. Researchers wanted to find ways to improve the situation. They discovered that playing games like ""whack-a-mole"" with the blindfolded eye helped the good seeing eye recover its skills. Playing these games while exercising on a treadmill seemed to give the best results. It is hoped that these techniques will help children who lose vision to learn better how to use the eye that still works. Adults might benefit too. People who wear glasses should take them off every once in a while to let their eyes rest! That helps keep the eyes healthy. Just like muscles, eyes need exercise to stay strong. Doctors recommend doing things like reading or going outside to get more exercise for your eyes. Play games with your kids to give your eyes a break and keep them strong. Make sure you protect your eyes from bright light and always wear sunglasses when outside. That way, your eyes won't have to work as hard and will last longer. Remember, just like physical exercises, mental exercises are good for you too! So don't forget to play games with family members or friends. Your brain will thank you! 1) Why is it important to take breaks when wearing glasses? 2) How can adults improve their eyesight? 3) Can playing games help my eyes? 4) Is it bad for my eyes to wear glasses all day? 5) Why do I need to wear sunglasess sometimes? 6) Does it really matter if I wear sungglasses indoors? 7) Why should I play games to improve my eyesight?"" 8) Are there special kinds of glasses that help improve eyesight?”"
"Colonies of tropical leaf-cutting ants live in underground nests where a fungus grows that feeds them . The ants , in turn , provide the fungus with the freshly-cut leaf fragments it needs for nutrition . The relationship between the ants and the fungus , in which they live close together and help one another survive , is known as symbiosis . It is an ancient , extremely well integrated relationship , in which neither species can survive without the other . However , the details of how the ants and the fungus work together to break down the leaf fragments so they can be used for nutrition are not well understood . When the ants eat the fungus , they do not digest its enzymes ( the proteins that accelerate chemical reactions in a cell ) . Instead , the fungal enzymes travel through the ants’ gut and into their fecal liquid , which gets deposited on the fresh-cut leaves when the ants collect them . The ants then make temporary pellets out of the new leaf fragments before providing them to the fungus . To better understand how each species contributes to the breakdown of the leaf fragments , Schiøtt and Boomsma identified all the proteins present in the fecal fluid of the ants . Once they had a complete list of about 100 proteins , they determined which of them were produced by the fungus and which by the ant . Schiøtt and Boomsma observed that certain combinations of fungal and ant enzymes could trigger a Fenton reaction – a chemical reaction that efficiently begins the breakdown of the tough walls around plant cells . This reaction is so aggressive that it is rarely found in nature , but it could help explain the high efficiency of the fungus and the ants symbiotically processing leaf fragments . But could a Fenton reaction actually proceed in the ants’ nest without hurting the ants or affecting the rest of the fungal garden ? The evidence obtained suggested that the temporary pellets made by the ants serve to isolate the reaction , so the aggressive chemistry takes place away from the ants and detached from the fungal gardens . Schiøtt and Boomsma showed that the symbiotic relationship between the ants and the fungus has led to a sustainable and efficient way of breaking down plant materials to use them for nutrition . The Fenton reaction is economically important in many industries , including bioethanol production , the detergent industry , and food production . Emulating the methods used by leaf-cutting ants , which have been fine-tuned by millions of years of natural selection , may allow humans to develop more efficient technologies for breaking down organic compounds ."," Ants eat leaves and feed them to fungi living inside their nests. The fungi break down the leaves into sugars and other useful materials. The ants drink the waste products of the fungi. Scientists wanted to know what kinds of things the an ts drink. They found out that the an t s drink lots of different kinds of proteins. Most of these proteins came from the fun gi, but some came from plants that the ant ate first. There were also some proteins that helped break down tough plant materials. Interestingly, there were lots of proteINS that made hydrogen PEROXIDE. This is a kind of chemical that can damage cells. The scientists thought that maybe this hydrogen PERoxide was part of a way to safely destroy plant materials outside the nest before eating them inside. They tested this idea and found out it worked! So, ants use both safe ways to digest food, just like humans. This is good news because it shows that ants can teach us new ways to safely digest food quickly and easily. Maybe we can learn from ants how to make better foods and faster digestion methods. That would be really cool! And maybe we could share these new foods with each oth er too!!!!!!.

"In order to form a tumour , cancer cells have to overcome the controls that normally prevent cells from dividing too often . These controls include an enzyme called PP2A , which inhibits cell division by regulating the activity of other proteins . In a normal cell , PP2A may be temporarily deactivated from time to time to enable the cell to divide . However , PP2A is permanently deactivated in many cancer cells , which allows these cells to divide many times in quick succession . A protein called Greatwall is involved in deactivating PP2A in healthy cells , but it was not clear whether increases in Greatwall activity can promote the formation of tumours . Here , Vera et al . use a variety of cell biology techniques to address this question . The experiments show that increasing the amount of Greatwall in human and mouse cells can promote some of the transformations needed for these cells to become cancerous . Also , Greatwall increases the growth of tumours in mice . These effects are caused by the over-activation of a protein called AKT , which is already known to promote the formation of many cancers . Vera et al . show that Greatwall regulates AKT activity using a different pathway to how it influences PP2A activity . Further experiments revealed that many human tumours , especially those from patients with colon cancer , produce excessive amounts of Greatwall protein . Together , these findings show that Greatwall can promote the development of cancer . A future challenge is to understand how this works and to find out whether high levels of Greatwall are a common feature of other human cancers ."," Cancer cells need to divide rapidly and move around to grow into large tumours. They do this by dividing unevenly, where one daughter cell stays put and grows bigger, while the other moves away. Sometimes, however, the daughter cells stay together and make a big clump. Scientists know that a special kind of protein called PP2AA stops this from happening. It makes sure that the cells divide evenly and don’t stick together. But sometimes, the cells manage to get rid of PP2AAAA and start to grow in big clumps. Recently, scientists discovered that there is a way to activate PP2AAAAAAAA again. By doing this, the cancer cell will divide even and won’t grow in a lump. So far, though, nobody knows exactly how to make PP2 AA come back. In this study, scientists wanted to learn about something else that controls how fast the cells grow and how much they move around. They looked at something called Greatwall, which they already knew was good at helping the cells go faster and move more. What they found was really interesting! When Greatwall was turned up very high, the PP2 A was turned down low. That means that Greatwall can make the cells move faster and grow more, just like turning PP2 down usually does. Then, the scientists learned that Greatball can also make the PP 2 A turn down low by getting rid of another protein called PHLAPP. This happened because Greatwall got rid of PHLPAP first, before PP2. Once the scientists figured out what Greatwall does, they wanted to know if Greatwall is bad for people who have cancer. They found that GreatWall is turned up in people who already have cancer, especially those whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body! So now scientists think that Great Wall is bad because it helps the cancer grow faster. They hope that finding out more about Greatwall will teach us how to stop it from working, so that we can find ways to stop cancer from coming back after treatment."
"The discovery of antibiotic drugs , which treat diseases caused by bacteria , has been a hugely valuable advance in modern medicine . They work by targeting specific cellular processes in bacteria , ultimately stopping them from multiplying or killing them outright . Antibiotics sometimes also affect their human hosts and can cause side-effects , such as gut problems or skin reactions . Recent evidence suggests that antibiotics also have an impact on the human immune system . This may happen either indirectly , by affecting ‘friendly’ bacteria normally present in the body , or through direct effects on immune cells . In turn , this could change the effectiveness of drug treatments . For example , if an antibiotic weakens immune cells , the body could have difficulty fighting off the existing infection – or become more vulnerable to new ones . However , even though new drugs are being introduced to combat the worldwide rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria , their effects on immunity are still not well understood . For example , bedaquiline is an antibiotic recently developed to treat tuberculosis infections that are resistant to several drugs . Giraud-Gatineau et al . wanted to determine if bedaquiline altered the human immune response to bacterial infection independently from its direct anti-microbial effects . Macrophages engulf foreign particles like bacteria and break them down using enzymes stored within small internal compartments , or ‘lysosomes’ . Initial experiments using human macrophages , grown both with and without bedaquiline , showed that the drug did not harm the cells and that they grew normally . A combination of microscope imaging and genetic analysis revealed that exposure to bedaquiline not only increased the number of lysosomes within macrophage cells , but also the activity of genes and proteins that increase lysosomes’ ability to break down foreign particles . These results suggested that bedaquiline treatment might make macrophages better at fighting infection , even if the drug itself had no direct effect on bacterial cells . Further studies , where macrophages were first treated with bedaquiline and then exposed to different types of bacteria known to be resistant to the drug , confirmed this hypothesis: in every case , the treated macrophages became efficient bacterial killers . In contrast , older anti-tuberculosis drugs did not have any such potentiating effect on the macrophages . This work sheds new light on our how antibiotic drugs can interact with the cells of the human immune system , and can sometimes even boost our innate defences . Such immune-boosting effects could one day be exploited to make more effective treatments against bacterial infections ."," Antibiotica are commonly used to treat bacterial diseases. But they might also harm our bodies. In this article, the authors studied how a special kind of antibiotal called Bedaquilina (BDQ) affected human bodys' defense against bacteria. First, the author found that BQD did not kill bacteria directly. Then, they found that treating human bodsys' cells with BQd changed the way the cells defended themselves against bacteria by making the cells more powerful. Finally, the found that this change happened because BQda helped the cells fight against bacteria better. So, BQDa could be useful for treating some kinds of disease caused by bacteria. It would be good to find out more about how BQDA work in the bodys and how safe it is to use. That way, doctors could know if BQDao is a good choice for treating patients. If BQdao is safe enough, it could be a good option for treating people who get sick from bacteria. And maybe it could even be used to fight against viruses like COVID-19. That would be really helpful! But first, more research needs to be done to figure out exactly how BDqa works in the bodies of people who take it. That will help make sure that BDA is safe to use and that it will actually help people get better. Overall, this is a very interesting and promising discovery! It could open up lots of possibilities for fighting against different kinds of diseases. More research needs be done though to make sure it is safe and effective. But overall, this seems like a potentially big breakthrough! It would definitely be worth looking into further. Good job, team! Keep up the excellent work! Let's hope this turns out to be a real game changer! Best wishes, everyone! Take care! 1 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/databases.htm 2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 3 https://clue.io/"
"Air enters our lungs through a system of airways that spread outwards from the windpipe like the branches of a tree . Before we are born , each branch is shaped by the organization and movement of cells that form the walls of the airways , called epithelial cells . This process requires the cells to communicate and coordinate with each other by receiving and/or sending chemical signals . One important system that epithelial cells use to communicate is called the Hippo pathway , which uses a molecule called YAP to execute received messages . Exactly how YAP helps airways in the lungs to develop was not well understood . By studying developing mouse lungs , Lin et al . have now found that YAP is present in the epithelial cells of all developing airways . Inactivating YAP in specific parts of the lungs prevented the formation of new branches of the airway in just those regions that lacked YAP . This suggests that YAP is needed for airways to branch properly and form the extensive network present in healthy lungs . Further investigation using genomics approaches revealed that YAP regulates the activity of genes that control how epithelial cells divide and contract . Without YAP , fewer cells were produced and they were unable to produce the forces required to change shape and move to form airways . In particular , YAP controls the production of a modified form of a protein called phosphorylated myosin light chain ( pMLC ) through a regulatory pathway . The pMLC protein is critical for the cells to produce the mechanical forces that they need to be able to contract correctly . Overall , the results presented by Lin et al . suggest that YAP controls the properties of the epithelial cells to enable them to form new airway branches . Branched structures also form in a number of other organs , and the mechanisms that cause these structures to form are thought to be similar to those that form the airways . Lin et al . ’s work could therefore help us to understand how organs develop more generally .","The lung grows bigger and branches out while you're inside your mother's belly. How does this happen? Researchers think that something like squeezing or pushing on the outside of the lung tissue makes the inside of the tissue push back. It turns out that this ""pushback"" happens because of something called YAP. YAP is a kind of chemical signal that tells cells to keep growing and dividing. Without enough YAP, the lung doesn't squeeze or push back, and it won't grow big enough or branch out. So, YAP helps the lung grow and branch out! But, researchers aren't sure exactly how much YAP you need, or what else might be happening besides just pushing back. More research needs to be done to figure that out. Right now though, scientists know that YAPP helps the lungs grow and stay healthy! That means that maybe someday doctors could learn ways to make more YAP in people who have problems with their lungs, like asthma or breathing problems after having a really sick lung infection. Doctors could also try to find ways to check how much of this special kind of signal is in someone's body, so they would know whether or not the person had a problem with their YAP signal. That way, doctors could start treating the problem earlier, before things got worse. That's pretty cool! Just remember, scientists haven't figured everything out yet, so more research needs doing before any of that can happen. But isn't science great because it keeps finding new ways to help us understand our bodies and how to keep 'em healthy?!? Yes, indeed it is! And we thank you for reading this article about how cool science is! Have a great day! Your friends at Science News for Kids 👨‍🎓🧐📚"
"Humans and other animals can use the five senses—touch , taste , sight , smell , and hearing—to interpret the world around them . Single-celled organisms , however , must rely on molecular cues to understand their immediate surroundings . In particular , bacteria gather information about external conditions , including potential hosts nearby , by secreting protein sensors that can relay messages back to the cell . Bacteria export these sensors via secretion systems that enable the organism both to receive information about the environment and to invade a host cell . A total of seven separate secretion systems , known as types I–VII , have been identified . These different secretion systems handle distinct cargoes , allowing the bacterial cell to respond to a range of feedback from the external milieu . The type III secretion system , also known as the ‘injectisome’ , is found in bacterial species that are enclosed by two membranes separated by a periplasmic space . The injectisome comprises different components that combine to form the basal body , which spans the inner and outer membranes , and a projection from the basal body , called the hollow needle , that mediates the export of cargo from a bacterium to its host or the local environment . The distance between the inner and outer membranes may vary across species or according to environmental conditions , so the basal body must be able to accommodate these changes . However , no mechanism has yet been established that might introduce such elasticity into the injectisome . Now , Kudryashev et al . have generated three-dimensional structures for the injectisomes of two species of bacteria , Shigella flexneri and Yersinia enterocolitica , and shown that the size of the basal body can fluctuate by up to 20% . Kudryashev et al . imaged whole injectisomes in these two species and found that the height of the basal body was proportional to the distance between the inner and outer membranes . To probe how this could occur , the properties of two proteins that are important components of the basal body were studied in greater detail . YscD , a protein that extends across the periplasmic space , was crystallized and its structure was then determined and used to develop a computer model to assess its compressibility: this model indicated that YscD could stretch or contract by up to 50% of its total length . The outer membrane component YscC also appeared elastic: when the protein was isolated and introduced into synthetic membranes , its length was reduced 30–40% relative to that observed in intact bacterial membranes . A further experiment confirmed the adaptability of the basal body: when the separation of the membranes was deliberately increased by placing bacteria in a high-salt medium , the basal body extended approximately 10% in length . Cumulatively , therefore , these experiments suggest that the in-built flexibility of the basal body of the injectisome allows bacteria to adjust to environmental changes while maintaining their sensory abilities and host-invasion potential ."," Scientists have discovered a special machine inside certain types of bacteria that lets them sneak into other cells and steal things from them. This machine is called an ""injectisome"" because it shoots a tiny piece of protein into another cell. Now scientists have figured out how this injectisom works! First, they looked at it really closely using something called x-ray diffraction. Then they took pictures of it using something else called electron microscopes. Finally, they used computers to figure out how all the pieces of the injectisoms fit together. They found that the injectismes have lots of different shapes and sizes, depending on whether they are inside the bacteria or shooting out of them. They think that this flexibility helps the injectasomes deal with being squished between the inside and outside walls of the bacteria. So, even though we don't yet completely understand why the injectisms need to be flexible, we know that they are! That's pretty cool! And now we know more about how these injectisones work, which could help us learn how to stop them from stealing stuff from our cells. That would be really good for us! And maybe we could even use this knowledge to fight diseases caused by bad bacteria. Neat! Science is awesome! 1) What is an injectisone? 2) How do injectisnes work? 3) Why do injectises need to bend? 4) Can we stop injectises from working? 5) Is there anything bad about having injectises? 6) Are there any good things about having infectises? Please explain. 7) Do you want to be friends with an injectise? 8) Will you hold my hand while I look at the pictures? 9) Can you tell me again about x rays? 11) Tell me more about electron microcopy. 13) What happened to the injectises in the story? 7.5) What did the computer do? 0.5). What is a disease? ½) What does 'bad' mean? ¼) What do you mean by 'good'? ¾) What's the difference between 'want' and 'like'?"
"Plants respond to changes in their environment by altering how they grow and when they reproduce . A protein called FERONIA is found in most types of cells and regulates many of the processes that drive these responses , such as cell growth and communication between male and female cells . FERONIA sits in the membrane that surrounds the cell , where it can detect molecules in the cell wall and from outside the cell , and send signals to locations within the cell . However , it is not clear how FERONIA is able to specifically regulate different processes to produce the right response in a particular cell at a particular time . A family of proteins called glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( GPI-APs for short ) play important roles in plants , animals , and other eukaryotic organisms . Li et al . studied FERONIA and two closely related GPI-APs called LLG1—which is produced in seedlings , and LORELEI , which is only found in female sex cells . The experiments show that plants missing either LLG1 or FERONIA had similar defects in growth and in how they respond to plant hormones . Plants missing LORELEI had similar defects in their ability to reproduce as the plants missing FERONIA . This suggests that FERONIA works with either LLG1 or LORELEI to regulate similar processes in different situations . Li et al . found that FERONIA binds to LLG1 in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum—where proteins are assembled—before both proteins are moved together to the cell membrane . In the absence of LLG1 , FERONIA fails to reach the cell membrane , and a large amount of FERONIA remains trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum . Therefore , LLG1 acts as a ‘chaperone’ that delivers FERONIA to the membrane where it is required to regulate plant growth . Li et al . found that LORELEI also interacts with FERONIA . Both LLG1 and LORELEI bind to the same region of FERONIA , which is on the outer surface of the cell membrane . These findings show that FERONIA is able to perform different roles in cells by teaming up with different members of the GPI-AP family of proteins . The next challenges will be to find out if , and how , LLG1 and LORELEI affect the ability of FERONIA to respond to signals from the cell wall and outside the cell ."," Plants have tiny seeds inside them that grow into adult plants. Before growing, the seeds need to absorb enough water so that the embryonic parts start developing. During this phase, the embroyo needs to get everything it needs to develop from the mother plant. One thing that the mother gives to her offspring is food in the form of starch. Starchy foods are converted into glucose, which is absorbed by the embreyo. It turns out that there are two ways to convert starch into gluecose: one way uses oxygen and the second does not. Both ways require the presence of certain proteins. Some of these are found in the embrio itself while others come from the maternal plant. For the latter, the materal plant makes a kind of sugar that is attached to the outside of the seed coat. Once the seed starts absorbing water, these sugars are taken up by the seed and the corresponding proteins are activated. Without these proteims, the seed would die. So, the sugars act like ""chaperones"" guiding the proteins to their correct location. This happens in the seed before it grows into a plant. The authors describe this phenomenon in detail and explain why it is important for the seed to grow into a healthy plant. They also discuss how this works in humans. Overall, the article shows that the mechanisms that allow seeds to grow are shared by plants and humans. Understanding how these mechanisms work will help us learn how to improve crop yields and treat human disease. The article also explains how the proteints that are needed for the embreno to grow can be provided by the matermal plant. This finding will lead to new ways of improving crop yields. Finally, the authors show that the proteinsts that help the embreno grow can also help people recover from illness. By understanding how these proteinst work, we can find new treatments for human disease."
"Single-celled microorganisms called archaea are one of the three domains of cellular life , along with bacteria and eukaryotes . Archaea are similar to bacteria in that they do not have nuclei , but genetically they have more in common with eukaryotes . Archaea are found in a wide range of habitats including the human colon , marshlands , the ocean and extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes . It has been known since the 1990s that the DNA of archaea is wrapped around histones to form complexes that closely resemble the nucleosomes found in eukaryotes , albeit with four rather than eight histone subunits . Nucleosomes are the fundamental units of chromatin , the highly-ordered and compact structure that all the DNA in a cell is packed into . Now we know exactly how many nucleosomes are present in a given cell for some eukaryotes , notably yeast , and to a good approximation we know the position of each nucleosome during a variety of metabolic states and physiological conditions . We can also quantify the nucleosome occupancy , which is measure of the length of time that the nucleosomes spend in contact with the DNA: this is a critical piece of information because it determines the level of access that other proteins , including those that regulate gene expression , have to the DNA . These advances have been driven in large part by advances in technology , notably high-density microarrays for genome wide-studies of nucleosome occupancy , and massively parallel sequencing for direct nucleosome sequencing . Ammar et al . have used these techniques to explore how the DNA of Haloferax volcanii , a species of archaea that thrives in the hyper-salty waters of the Dead Sea , is organized on a genome-wide basis . Despite some clear differences between the genomes of archaea and eukaryotes—for example , genomic DNA is typically circular in archaea and linear in eukaryotes—they found that the genome of Hfx . volcanii is organized into chromatin in a way that is remarkably similar to that seen in all eukaryotic genomes studied to date . This is surprising given that the chromatin in eukaryotes is confined to the nucleus , whereas there are no such constraints in archaea . In particular , Ammar et al . found that those regions of the DNA near the ends of genes that mark where the transcription of the DNA into RNA should begin and end contain have lower nucleosome occupancy than other regions . Moreover , the overall level of occupancy in Hfx . volcanii was twice that of eukaryotes , which is what one would expect given that nucleosomes in archaea contain half as many histone subunits as nucleosomes in eukaryotes . Ammar et al . also confirmed that that the degree of nucleosome occupancy is correlated with gene expression . These two findings—the similarities between the chromatin in archaea and eukaryotes , and the correlation between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in archaea—raise an interesting evolutionary possibility: the initial function of nucleosomes and chromatin formation might have been for the regulation of gene expression rather than the packaging of DNA . This is consistent with two decades of research that has shown that there is an extraordinary and complex relationship between the structure of chromatin and the process of gene expression . It is possible , therefore , that as the early eukaryotes evolved , nucleosomes and chromatin started to package DNA into compact structures that , among other things , helped to prevent DNA damage , and that this subsequently enabled the early eukaryotes to flourish ."," Scientists know that the building blocks of DNA need to be packed together tightly so that they don’t get tangled up. They also know that this packing happens thanks to something called “chromatin”. There are lots of different types of chromatins, including ones made out of special proteins called “histones” that come from bacteria living deep under the ocean. Researchers wanted to learn more about these kinds of chromatis. So, they took samples from a type of bacteria called Haloperfix volcanili and put them through a machine that broke apart the chromatin into smaller pieces. Then, they looked at those small pieces to find out what parts of the DNA were wrapped up in the chromain. Next, they checked to see which parts of DNA were being actively used to make copies of themselves or to make proteins. What they found was pretty cool! Some of the parts of chromain were close to areas where the bacteria were making copies of itself, and some were far away. That means that even though these bacteria live very differently from us, they use chromatin to organize their DNA in kind of the same way! And that shows us that chromatin has probably always been really important since the beginning of life on earth. Who knows? Maybe there are even more amazing discoveries waiting to be made about things that happen deep underwater! Just like here on land, you never know what you will find if you take the time to look.

"Limiting the amount of protein eaten , while still eating enough to avoid starving , has an unexpected effect: it can slow down aging and extend the lifespan in many animals from flies to mice . Previous work suggests that how an animal perceives food can also influence how fast the animal ages . For example , both flies and worms actually have shorter lifespans if their food intake is reduced when they can still “smell” food in their environment . However , the sensory cues that trigger changes in lifespan and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown . Ro et al . therefore asked whether fruit flies recognize protein in their food , and if so , whether such a recognition system would influence how the flies age . Flies that had been deprived of food for a brief period tended to eat more protein than other flies that had not been starved . Ro et al . then revealed that serotonin , a brain chemical that can alter the activity of nerve cells , plays a key role in how fruit flies decide to feed specifically on foods that contain protein . Further experiments revealed also that flies age faster when they are allowed to interact with protein in their diet independently from other nutrients , despite eating the same amount . Disrupting any of several components involved in serotonin signaling protected the flies from this effect and led to them living almost twice as long under these conditions . Ro et al . propose that the components of the recognition system work together to determine the reward associated with consuming protein by enhancing how much an animal values the protein in its food . As such , it is this protein reward or value – rather than just eating protein itself – that influences how quickly the fly ages . Further work is now needed to understand how the brain mechanisms that allow animals to perceive and evaluate food act to control lifespan and aging ."," Researchers found that eating too much protein can shorten the lives of fruit flies. Flies fed a ""choice"" diet containing equal amounts of sugar and yeast lived significantly longer than flies fed a restricted ""starvation"" diet lacking yeast. Surprisingly, flies fed the starvational diet preferred to eat yeast rather than sugar when offered a choice. This surprising preference was controlled by the way the brain uses chemicals called serotonins. Serotonins helped guide the flies' choices about what to eat. Changing the levels or activity of specific serotonergic molecules changed the flies’ preferences for yeast versus sugar. A similar change in yeast preference occurred when flies were exposed to a brief period of starvations. The researchers discovered that the brains of flies fed starvatal diets contained higher levels of a kind of serotoin called seratonin. Starving flies also produced more serotonocin, another kind of molecule made by the same gene. Finally, the researchers found that changing the levels and activity of serothonin-related molecules did not affect the flies intake of sugars or yeast, nor did it affect the intakes of calories or proteins. Instead, the serotonincin-controlled yeast preferences seemed to influence the flies survival. The study suggests that the brain's use of serthonin helps flies choose foods that improve their chances of surviving. Future research might explore whether people's decisions about what foods to eat are also guided by serotoniocin. Such research could lead to insights about why people tend to crave meat when they are malnourished. It could also provide clues about why older adults seem to prefer sweet tastes over sour or bitter flavours. And it could shed light on why people living with depression or anxiety disorders often lose their appetites. By studying the links between nutrition, serotonian signalling, and behaviour, scientists hope to develop treatments for mood disorders and other mental illnesses."
"Mutations in genes play important roles in many types of cancer . However , mutations alone cannot explain all the biological changes that occur to cancer cells . For example , very few mutations have been linked with a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( or ccRCC for short ) . Instead , scientists suspect that this cancer is largely caused by changes in the expression of particular genes so that certain cancer-promoting genes are more highly expressed , while other genes that would prevent tumor growth become less active . One of the few genes that is often mutated in ccRCC is called SETD2 . This gene is involved in processes that alter the structure of DNA , but do not alter the genes themselves . These “epigenetic” changes can alter how the instructions in genes are used to make proteins . The first step in making proteins is to use a section of DNA as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) in a process called transcription . There are markers within a gene that show where transcription should start and stop to produce the mRNA required to make a particular protein . Epigenetic changes can mask these markers so that the cell produces longer mRNAs that incorporate instructions from neighboring genes . It was not known how often these stop signs are ignored in ccRCC cells . Here , Grosso et al . compared transcription in normal cells and in ccRCC tumor cells from 50 different patients . The experiments show that more stop signs were ignored in many of the cancer cells , especially in cells with mutations in SETD2 . This caused all or parts of neighboring genes to be transcribed along with the target gene and led to changes in the expression levels of these genes . For example , a cancer-promoting gene called BCL2 was more highly expressed in these cells . Furthermore , some of the mRNA molecules produced in these cancer cells may make “fusion” proteins that combine elements from several proteins . These fusion proteins may work differently to normal cell proteins and therefore might also promote the development of tumors . Grosso et al . ’s findings reveal a new link between epigenetic changes and cancer .","There are special events during which the process of reading the information contained in the genes continues past the end of the gene, resulting in the production of unusual RNA products. These events happen often in kidney cancer cells and seem to cause the production in these same cells of unusually long RNA copies of genes involved in the initiation of kidney tumours. Some of these unusually extended RNA versions include parts of another gene, forming hybrid RNA forms. It is unknown what causes these events to take place. Now, researchers named Zhang and colleagues investigated why these events occur in kidneys cells. They looked at the RNAs produced in kidny cancer cells, both those that normally ended at the end o fthe gene and those that went past the usual stop signal. They found that the latter group had something in common: they came from genes whose functions were important for the development and spread of kideny cancer cells. Next, they tried to figure out why these unusual RNAS continued past the normal stop signals. They noticed that there was a problem with the spelling of the word ""stop"" in the instructions that tell the enzyme responsible for producing RNA to stop copying the gene once it reaches the end. Then, they showed that fixing this spelling error prevented the production o f the unusual RNSs. Finally, they demonstrated that correcting this speling error stopped the spread of cancerous cells. Overall, the authors concluded that problems with the instructions for making RNA can cause the creation of unusual, potentially harmful RNA hybrids. Fixing these errors might help prevent the spread o f cancer cells in people. Further work is necessary to determine whether similar events occur elsewhere in the bodies o f people who get cancer. If so, it will be important to find ways to fix these errors safely in order to reduce the risk of developing cancer. The methods developed here might eventually make it possible to do just that."
"Fat is an important part of our diet . The intestines absorb fats and package them into particles called lipoproteins . After reaching the bloodstream , the fat molecules ( lipids ) in the lipoproteins are broken down by an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , which is located along the surface of small blood vessels . This releases nutrients that can be used by vital tissues – mainly the heart , skeletal muscle , and adipose tissues . LPL is produced by muscle and adipose tissue , but it is quickly swept up by a protein called GPIHBP1 and shuttled to its site of action inside the blood vessels . Mutations that alter the structure of LPL or GPIHBP1 can prevent the breakdown of lipids , resulting in high levels of lipids in the blood . This can lead to inflammation in the pancreas and also increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes . Many earlier studies have examined the properties of LPL , but our understanding of GPIHBP1 has been limited , mainly because it has been difficult to purify GPIHBP1 for analysis . Using genetically altered insect cells , Mysling et al . were able to purify two different forms of GPIHBP1 – a full-length version and a shorter version that lacked a small section at the end of the molecule known as the acidic domain . This revealed that the opposite end of the molecule – called the carboxyl-terminal domain – is primarily responsible for binding LPL and anchoring it inside blood vessels . Once LPL is bound to GPIHBP1 , the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 helps to stabilize LPL . If GPIHBP1’s acidic domain is missing then LPL is more susceptible to losing its structure , rendering it incapable of breaking down the lipids in the blood . Mysling et al . describe a new model for how LPL and GPIHBP1 interact that explains how specific mutations in the genes that encode these proteins interfere with the delivery of LPL to small blood vessels . In the future , this could help researchers to develop new strategies to treat people with high levels of lipids in their blood ."," When fatty foods enter your bloodstream, certain types of fats travel through your veins until they reach tiny vessels called capillaires. There, special proteins named lipoprotiens break up the fats and pass them to nearby cells, which then use them for energy. But sometimes, too much fat enters your system at once, and the lipoprtiens can’t keep up. As a result, little pieces of fat start to build up in places like your artery walls. Over time, this can cause clogs, which reduce blood flow and make it harder for cells to get what they need. Scientists have learned that a protein named GPIHPB1 helps break down fats in your blood and keep them from building up in your arteries. New research has shown that GPI HPB1 works by helping another protein called lipopotein lipose break down big fats into smaller ones that your body can use. By doing this, GPI HBP1 keeps your blood flowing smoothly and helps prevent clogs from forming. Understanding how GPIhp1 works could help doctors find better ways to treat people who have too much cholesterol in their blood. For example, they might develop medicines that boost the action of lipoportein lipse, or teach patients to eat healthier diets so that their bodies don’t need as much help breaking down fatt. That would give you a better chance of staying healthy and living longer!. The researchers used a technique called “cross linking” to figure out how GPHBP1 works with lipopritein lipsee. Cross linking lets scientists watch how different parts of proteins move and change shape when they interact with each other. By watching these changes happen, scientists can learn more about how the proteinst work together. In this case, the researchers found that GPHPB1 has two different parts that work together to help lipoprotatein lipaste break down fat. One part is a long stretch of amino acid that doesn’t have a regular shape. The other part is the part of GPIhbp1 that attaches it to your cell membranes. Without this second part, the protein can’ts help break down the fat. And without the first part, lipopprotein lipast can’s do its job properly. So, when GPI hpb1 and lipopratein lipost work together, they can break down bigger fats so that your"
"Cells need to make proteins in order to survive . To make a protein , a cell first needs to take the information from a gene coded in its DNA and copy it into a template made of a different molecule called RNA via a process called transcription . Not all genes are transcribed or expressed at the same time or the same rate , because a cell needs different proteins depending on its environment . The molecules that regulate when each gene is transcribed are called transcription factors . When the bacterium Escherichia coli is starved for the building blocks it needs to make proteins , it changes the expression of almost one quarter of its genes within 5 minutes . This broad response requires two transcription factors , ppGpp and DksA . Unlike most transcription factors , these two molecules bind directly to the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA , the RNA polymerase , but they do not bind to DNA . Another transcription factor called TraR can mimic the combined effects of ppGpp and DksA on transcription , changing the conformation of RNA polymerase in the same way . Now , Chen et al . have used a high-resolution imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the details of how the structure of RNA polymerase changes in response to TraR binding , and by analogy , in response to ppGpp and DksA . The experiments showed that TraR interacts with regions of RNA polymerase that move when the protein binds DNA . These interactions can either help or hinder the start of transcription depending on which DNA sequence the RNA polymerase binds . Using the structures obtained via cryo-electron microscopy as guides , Chen et al . mutated each of the mobile parts of RNA polymerase individually to determine which interactions with TraR were necessary to change gene expression . These results shed light on a fundamental process in all living cells , the initiation of transcription , and how it changes in response to the cell's nutritional environment . This may help explain how different cells regulate gene expression and may also lead to the development of new antibiotics ."," Scientists have learned about something called TraR, which comes from bacteria and affects how certain things get made inside cells. They know that TraR works together with another thing called Dks, and that Tra R makes things happen just like Dks plus another molecule called ppG does. But exactly how TraR and Dks work isn’t really clear. So, scientists took samples from cells where TraR is active and where it isn’ t active, and looked at them very closely using special tools. They saw that when TraR wasn’ t around, one part of the machine that makes things (called RNAPI) was in one position. But when Tra R was around, RN API moved to a slightly different spot. Scientists think this movement might be important for helping make some things, but not others. And they think that moving RN AP I to this spot might be how Dks and ppG work too. Finally, scientists wanted to see if adding TraR to a different kind of machine (called EΔ 1.1σ 70 ), which doesn’ t usually make things, would cause it to start working. Adding TraR did stop the machine from doing whatever it was going to do, but it didn’ t start making anything either. So scientists think that maybe TraR only helps machines work when they aren’ t already busy making stuff. Or maybe Tra R helps machines make one kind of thing, but stops them from making another kind. More studies need to be done to figure out why TraR helps machines like RN Api make things sometimes, but keeps them from working other times. Figuring this out might teach us more about how machines work inside our bodies, and how to fix them when they break. It might also let us know ways to keep our bodies healthy, or to fight sickness better. Or it might tell us how to make better medicines."
"Eating can occur for many different reasons . We often eat not simply because we are hungry , but because we have learned to eat at specific times of day or in response to factors in our environments ( for example , an advert that reminds of us of something tasty ) . Despite this , few researchers have investigated how biological signals from the gut communicate with the brain to enable this type of learned , or “conditioned” , feeding behavior . Brain cells called neurons communicate with each other in specific circuits that can cross between different brain regions . Hsu et al . have now developed a “disconnection neuropharmacology” approach , which alters whether the neurons in different brain regions can communicate with each other , to investigate the effects signaling molecules have on brain activity and behavior . Using this approach in rats revealed a new circuit in the brain that controls learned feeding behavior through ghrelin , a hormone that is released from the stomach and increases appetite . Hsu et al . found that the hippocampus , a brain region important for learning and memory control , uses ghrelin as a signal to engage in learned feeding behavior . Neurons in the hippocampus that respond to ghrelin communicate with other neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus ( known for its role in feeding ) that produce a signaling molecule called orexin . This circuit therefore links memory and feeding behavior . Future work will investigate the neural circuits between the hippocampus and other brain regions that are important for feeding behavior , and the hormones that are important for triggering activity in these circuits ."," Scientists have discovered a new way that our brains decide when and how much to eat. They found that a special kind of ""hunger hormone"" called ghre lin makes sure that we feel like eating at the same time each day. Ghrelin comes from a part of our brain called the hippockampus. Normally, ghre ln tells our bodies when it is time to eat something. But scientists found that there is another part in our brain where ghre ll needs to talk to called the later hypotholmus. There are tiny bits of nerve cells in both places that send messages back and forth. The later hypoholmus is very important because it decides when we should eat. If someone feels hungry, it means that the two parts of our brains cannot talk to each other anymore. So, scientists injected ghrellin into the hipokcampus of rats. Then, they looked to see what happened to the nerves in the later hyproholmus. They saw that the nerves started working again! That meant that ghreolin told the later hypeoholmu to start talking to the hipocompus again. Finally, scientists gave rats a drug that blocked the later hipotholms from being able to receive messages from the hipocampuss. Even though the rats still felt hungry, they would not eat anything unless they got an extra dose of ghreelin in their hipocompu. This shows that gherelinn needs to tell the laterhyppo holmus to start eating again before we can feel like having food. And that means that ghrselin helps us feel hungry at the right times of day! This discovery might help doctors find better ways to treat people who have trouble deciding when to eat, like people with diabetes. Or maybe it could teach us more about how to keep our bodies healthy. Maybe one day it will even let us figure out ways to stop feeling hungry sometimes!"
"Dengue fever – a disease spread by mosquitos – causes large outbreaks in Asia and the South Pacific islands . Health agencies often try to reduce the spread of the disease by removing mosquito breeding grounds , like old tires and containers that may hold standing water . But it can be difficult to tell whether these preventive measures work because dengue transmission depends on many factors , including the weather and how many people had developed immunity because of previous infections . A common way to study patterns of infection and immunity is to collect blood samples from a subset of the population before and after an outbreak . Unfortunately , large dengue outbreaks occur sporadically on islands , making it hard to set up a study like this ahead of an outbreak . During 2013 and 2014 , there was a major dengue outbreak in Fiji , with over 25 , 000 suspected cases reported . In response , the government introduced a nationwide mosquito clean-up campaign . As luck would have it , a group of researchers had collected blood samples immediately before the outbreak for an unrelated study of typhoid fever and leptospirosis . Now , Kucharski et al . – who include the researchers who collected those pre-outbreak blood samples – show that the clean-up campaign coincided with a reduction in transmission of the disease . Participants whose blood was collected before the dengue outbreak were invited to provide another blood sample after the dengue outbreak . This allowed Kucharski et al . to identify individuals who had already developed immunity to dengue before the outbreak and those who were likely infected during the outbreak . Comparing blood samples taken before and after the outbreak revealed that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . No other demographic or environmental factors were strongly linked to the likelihood of infection . Computer models using the data also showed that the clean-up efforts could explain the reduced dengue transmission during the outbreak . These findings suggest that studying immunity against dengue can lead to a better understanding of disease transmission . This may help health agencies to gauge the effects of efforts to control this disease , and possibly forecast future outbreaks ."," Dengue virus is a serious illness that affects millions of people every year. To understand why this happens, researchers looked at blood tests taken from people living in Fijian islands before and during a denguing outbreak. They also studied records kept by doctors and nurses showing how many people got sick and how severe their symptoms were. By combining all of this information together, the scientists were able to figure out which groups of people were most likely to get sick. They found that adults aged ten to nineteen were most at risk of getting dengued. They didn’t find any other things that seemed to put people at extra risk of catching the virus. Using math models, the team also figured out how the outbreak happened and how it might have been controlled. They think that the outbreak started because lots of people weren’t immune to the dengu virus, meaning they hadn’t already caught it and their bodies were ready to fight it off. Later on, the outbreak ended quickly because of a government program that cleaned up trash and containers that mosquitoes like to live in. Overall, the researchers learned a lot about what puts people at risk for dengui and how outbreaks happen. Their work will help doctors know who to test for dengu and how to stop big outbreaks from happening again. This will keep people safe and healthy! Scientists hope that other places can learn from Fiji’s example to prevent and treat dengues too! 1) What is dengie? 2) Who is at risk from getting denge? 3) How can you tell if someone has dengoe? 4) Why did the outbreak of dengoes start and end? 5) Can other places learn from what Fiji did to stop the dengu outbreak? 6) What did the scientists learn from studying the dengers? 7) Will there ever be a vaccine for the denger?"
"Trypanosoma brucei are single-celled parasites that cause human sleeping sickness and animal diseases . Like in other organisms , the parasite contains different compartments , each having several specific roles . The mitochondrion is the compartment that provides most of the energy needed to keep the cell alive . Many cellular processes , such as those that happen in the mitochondrion , produce compounds including hydrogen peroxide that can cause ‘oxidative damage’ . To counteract this , cells make small molecules called thiols . These thiols provide ‘reducing’ power to chemically balance out the oxidative damage . Trypanosomes have an unusual thiol system that relies on a molecule called trypanothione . Trypanosoma brucei cells make trypanothione in the cytosol , the fluid which surrounds all cellular compartments; here it is also used up with the help of a protein called tryparedoxin . However , it was not known which thiols are present in the mitochondrion . Ebersoll et al . have now made a molecular sensor that can detect trypanothione . The sensor includes a fluorescent protein , which changes its brightness based on its oxidation state , fused to the tryparedoxin protein . This probe could either be put in the cytosol or mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei cells . Treating the cells with hydrogen peroxide changed the fluorescence of the biosensor . Trypanosoma brucei cells without tryparedoxin protein in their cytosol still responded to an oxidative challenge in the mitochondrion . The experiments reveal that trypanosomes do have a mitochondrial trypanothione system . This new fluorescent biosensor will be used to study how other cellular compartments deal with oxidative conditions . The tests will reveal how different compartments communicate with each other to counteract the stress . The sensor could also be used to determine how anti-parasite drugs affect the cells’ trypanothione system ."," Parasite trypnosomes need oxygen to survive, so they produce lots of chemicals to deal with any damage done by having too much oxygen. Some of these chemicals come from something called ""mitochondries"" that take oxygen away from damaging parts of the cell. There are ways to tell if the chemical levels are getting too low or too high using special probes. Using these probes, researchers found that trypano-some mitochonds contain a way to make extra versions of these protective chemicals. Without this way, the parasites cannot handle having too many oxygen molecules around. Researchers think that this way involves a protein with a name starting with 'try'. This protein is probably not enough to fix everything though, since the parasite still makes other kinds of protective chemicals too. Overall, this shows that trynopsoamines have a way of dealing with too much air that happens mostly in the mitchondrias. Further research should find out exactly how this way works and why it doesn't completely solve the problem. This will help scientists learn how to stop parasites from causing diseases like African sleeping sickeness. 1. What is the main issue? 2. How does the scientist try to solve the issue?

"Our skeleton stays healthy through an endless regeneration process , with specialized cells constantly absorbing and creating new bone tissue . Illnesses emerge when this breaking down and rebuilding cycle becomes imbalanced . For instance , in Paget’s disease of bone ( PDB for short ) the skeleton becomes misshapen and fragile , with complications including pain , fractures , neurological problems , hearing loss and even cancer . For most patients however , symptoms are only present at an advanced stage , when irreversible damage to the skeleton has already occurred . Certain inherited genetic changes play a role in the development of PDB , but lifestyle and environmental factors are also thought to contribute . Indeed , accumulating evidence suggests that diet , pollution and infection may influence how genes involved in bone metabolism are activated . In this process , the environment may trigger chemical marks to be added onto DNA sequences , which ultimately switches specific genes on and off . To investigate whether the pattern of chemical marks in individuals with PDB may be characteristic , Diboun et al . scanned the genetic information of over 200 PDB patients , and compared it to healthy counterparts . Combining genomic analysis and machine learning revealed several chemical signatures that were remarkably different in the DNA of PDB individuals . These signatures affected sites close to genes involved in bone development , as well as response to mechanical loading and infection . This provides strong evidence that PDB could be , in part , triggered by the environment , as the placement of these marks is highly influenced by external factors . This research sheds light onto the underlying changes that trigger PDB . Future experiments should explore whether it may be possible to use these genetic changes to identify patients before the onset of irreversible and debilitating damage ."," Scientists wanted to learn about changes in the way certain genes are turned on or turned off (called ""epigenetic"" changes) in people who have a condition called Pagets Disease of Bone (PDB). They did this by comparing the amount of turning on or turning off of certain genes in white blood cells taken from 126 people who had PDB compared to 266 people without PDB. They found that 18 out of 19 genes had changed amounts of turning of in people with PBD compared to those without. Of these 17 genes, 15 were involved in things like how strong bones are, how bones break down, and how the body fights germs. Researchers think that one reason for these changes might be because of something that happens early in life, maybe even before birth. If they can figure out exactly what this is, they might be able to treat PDB earlier and stop it from getting worse. They also looked at how much these genes were turned on and off in white cells versus bone cells from 3 people with PDG and found that some of them were pretty similar. That means that measuring how much they turn on and turn off in blood cells might tell doctors if someone has PDB or not. Overall, this study shows that changes in how genes are controlled in PDB might happen because of things that happened early in the person's life, and that checking how much certain genes turn on or turn off might be a good way to test for PDB later in life. Future research should try to find out what causes these changes to happen and see if treating them helps people with this disease. More detailed explanation: Pagents Disease Of Bone is a disorder characterized by excessive bone turnover and expansion of osteoblastic and osteclast lineage. While the exact cause of this disease is still unknown, genetic predisposition and environmental factors play a role in its manifestation. Epigenetic alterations have recently emerged as another layer of complexity in the pathobiology of PDBG. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate epigenome-scale DNA methylome changes in whole blood samples obtained from individuals diagnosed with PDBG. Using a combination of differential methylations analyses, the group identified 1,166 differentially hypermethylated and 2,348 hypomethylate Cpgs in PDBG patients compared to controls. Amongst these,"
"Blood cells perform many important roles in animals , including transporting oxygen around the body and defending against invading microbes . There are many similarities between how blood cells develop in vertebrate animals , such as humans , and in fruit flies . Therefore , researchers often use fruit flies as models to study how vertebrates make new blood cells . Fruit fly larvae produce new blood cells in the lymph gland from “progenitor” cells that show several similarities to the stem cells that make blood cells in vertebrates , known as Hematopoietic Stem Cells ( or HSCs for short ) . The progenitor cells grow and divide and subsequently develop into mature blood cells . The fate of the progenitor cells depend on signals produced from an adjoining group of specialized cells that serve as its niche . For example , a signal protein called Hedgehog delivered from the niche maintains the progenitor cells . On the other hand , HSCs in vertebrates rely on another signal protein called BMP to maintain them . Although the progenitor cells present in the lymph gland are believed to behave like vertebrate stem cells , it is not clear whether fruit flies also have groups of HSCs . Dey et al . studied the fates of cells in the lymph glands of fruit fly larvae . The experiments reveal a new group of cells in the lymph gland that behave like vertebrate stem cells and give rise to progenitor cells . Since the newly discovered cells also depend on a niche for their maintenance , Dey et al . named them HSCs . Further experiments show that , like HSCs in vertebrates , the fruit fly HSCs use Dpp ( the fruit fly equivalent of BMP ) as a niche signal . The next challenge is to use fruit fly HSCs as models to study how the blood develops in vertebrates , and how this is altered in individuals with blood disorders ."," Researchers discovered that certain types of cells in the lymphant, a part of the immune system in fruit flies, act like stem cells in mammals. They named these cells after a type of stem cells found in mammalian bone marrow. To learn about these cells, scientists looked at what happens to these cells in fruit fly lymphan glands when a particular kind of chemical signal is turned off. Normally, this signal helps keep the stem cells alive. Without this signal, the stem cell population decreases. This decrease can be stopped if another kind of signal is added. So, just like in mammalia, the cells in flies need special chemicals to stay alive. Now scientists know where to look for similar kinds of stem in mammali. Studying these stem cells could help doctors figure out ways to treat people who have problems with their immune systems. It could also help us learn more about how stem cells work in general. We still don’t really know what stem cells are or why they are so important. For example, we don’tknow exactly how stemcells help keep us healthy. Figuring out answers to questions like this is going to take a lot more research. But knowing more about stem cells might help us come up with new ways to fight cancer and other illnesses. And maybe it will teach us how to make ourselves healthier too! That’s why studying things like stem cell in fruit flie sare so important! They give us clues about how to start looking for answers to big questions. Plus, they let us test out ideas to see if they work or not. If we can figure out how stem cell work in fruit files, we might get closer to understanding how they work in us! And that could lead to finding ways to fix problems with our bodies. That’sdifficult, but it’s worth trying! Just like anything else worth doing, it takes time and patience. But if we stick with it, we can learn lots of cool things!"
"The lungs enable the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the bloodstream . This exchange happens in structures called alveoli , which have a large surface area that aids in efficient gas exchange . Shortly after birth in mice , or during the last few months before birth in humans , alveoli develop folds called secondary septa that increase their surface area and improve the efficiency of gas exchange . Several types of cells work together to form secondary septa . Surface cells called epithelia and underlying “myofibroblast” cells and small blood vessels must both communicate and move together to build the septa . The processes that control the formation of septa have not been fully studied . In other cases , a cell signaling pathway known as the planar cell polarity ( PCP ) pathway has been shown to help coordinate cell movements . The PCP pathway works by changing the cytoskeleton of cells , which is the series of protein fibers that give cells their shape and structure and the ability to move . Zhang et al . have now studied septa in mouse lungs and revealed how three genes – Wnt5a , Ror2 and Vangl2 – in the PCP pathway control this process . This pathway oversees changes to the cytoskeleton in both epithelial cells and myofibroblasts , helping the cells to change shape and move together to form septa . Unusually , the PCP pathway has different effects in different cells , rather than affecting all cells similarly . This is partly due to so-called PDGF signals from the epithelial cells that help to guide the growth and movement of myofibroblasts . This process is helped by the epithelial cells changing their shape to accommodate myofibroblasts during septa formation . Further analysis also showed reduced PCP signaling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , also known as COPD . This could be a factor in the extensive lung damage seen in these patients . These findings help to explain a key lung development process and may provide new insights to understand lung diseases such as COPD ."," During the last few years, scientists discovered that a special kind of communication between cells called ""planar cell polarization"" helps build many different kinds of tissues in the human body. One example is the air sacs in the lungs. They looked at how this works in mink and found that a particular protein called ""vanglin"" plays an important part. They then looked at samples taken from people who had problems breathing because of a disease called emphysema. By looking closely at the air sacks in these samples, they saw that the vanglin protein wasn't working properly. This finding could lead to better treatments for emphysemas patients. Next steps include figuring out exactly why the venglin protein isn't doing its job right in people with emphyemia and testing ways to make it work again. This study gives us more knowledge about how our bodies make and keep healthy air sac tissue. It also shows us a good example of how studying things in minks can teach us lessons that apply to humans too! That's pretty cool! And it reminds us that even though minks and people look really different on the outside, sometimes they're quite alike on the inside! Who knows? Maybe learning more about how air sac tissues work in mINKS will help doctors figure out ways to help people breathe easier! Cool, huh? Yes! Very much so!!!

"Proteins are built from molecules called amino acids . The amino acids that make up a particular protein , and the order they appear in , are determined by the gene that encodes that protein . First , the gene is transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA , which is then translated by a molecular machine called a ribosome . This involves other RNA molecules , called transfer RNAs ( tRNAs ) , bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome , which then joins the amino acids together to build the protein . Amino acids are loaded onto their corresponding tRNA molecules by enzymes called tRNA synthetases . Occasionally , however , the wrong amino acid can be loaded onto a tRNA . If this amino acid ends up in a protein , the protein might not be able to function properly , or it might even be toxic to the cell , so cells need to be able to fix this problem . Some tRNA synthetases can check if a wrong amino acid has been loaded onto a tRNA , and remove it before it can cause harm . However , the importance of these ‘editing’ activities to living cells is unclear . Here , Bullwinkle , Reynolds et al . show that , in the bacterium E . coli , a tRNA synthetase works to stop an incorrect amino acid—which accumulates in cells that are exposed to harmful chemicals—from being built into proteins . Without the enzyme’s editing activity , the build-up of this amino acid slows the growth of the bacteria . However , E . coli can thrive without this editing activity when it is grown under normal conditions in a laboratory . Yeast benefit slightly from this editing activity when exposed to the stress-produced amino acid . But , unlike E . coli , yeast strongly rely on this activity when grown in an excess of another amino acid , which is used to build proteins but is the wrong amino acid for this tRNA synthetase . The findings of Bullwinkle , Reynolds et al . will help to improve our understanding of which activities in a cell are most affected by mistakes in protein synthesis , and how these mistakes may relate to disease ."," Scientists have studied how bacteria make sure they put the right amino-acids into proteins. They found that sometimes things can go wrong because of mistakes in putting the aminos together. Sometimes the wrong kind of aminos get attached to the tRNA. If too much of this happens, the proteins don't work properly anymore. So, bacteria have another step in their process to fix this. It turns out that this extra step is important for the bacteria to survive. Without it, they cannot grow normally. This shows us that the bacteria need this special step to deal with problems that happen often. But, we don' t know exactly why this mistake keeps happening. Maybe it's because of something else going wrong somewhere else in the process. Or maybe it' s just bad luck. Whatever the reason, the bacteria have to fix it. That's why this step is so important. It helps them keep working normally despite the mistakes that happen. This tells us that even though things seem to be going wrong, the system actually knows how to handle it. So even though we think we found a big mistake, it might not really be a mistake at all! Just like when you play a game and you thought you lost, but then you realized you actually won! That would feel pretty good, right? Knowing your ""mistake"" wasn' t really a mistake after all! That' s how science helps us learn more about things. Even when we think everything went wrong, sometimes we find out that nothing went wrong at all. And sometimes we even discover something cool that nobody ever noticed before! That's how scientists figure out stuff that no one knew before. They look at things really closely and pay attention to tiny details that might tell them something bigger about how things work. That's how we learned about this special way bacteria deal with their mistakes. Cool, huh?!"
"Animal cells can secrete proteins and molecules into the space around them to create a support they can attach to . This structure – known as the extracellular matrix – comes in various forms and can help to shape tissues or influence the way in which cells behave . Inside cells , filaments made of a protein called actin also provide structural support . In fruit fly larvae , “tracheal” cells create a network of tubes that will form the airways of the adult fly . Once this network is complete , these cells secrete the materials to make an extracellular matrix in the internal ( apical ) surface of the tubes . This matrix has a series of spiralling ridges made from a molecule called chitin . These ridges run along the tubes , spanning several cells and providing the mechanical strength needed to keep the airways open . The ridges appear to form through a co-ordinated effort between the cells , and recent studies suggest that actin filaments may be involved in this process . Here , Öztürk-Çolak et al . investigate this idea further by carrying out a detailed analysis of the relationship between the extracellular matrix and the tracheal cells as the airways develop . The experiments reveal that rings of actin filaments form on the apical side of tracheal cells before the ridges appear . These rings generate regular folds in the membrane that surrounds each tracheal cell and are required for an enzyme to accumulate in the cells . This enzyme produces chitin , leading to its deposition in stripes above the actin rings . Further experiments show that the junctions between cells play an important role in organising the pattern of the extracellular matrix . The active form of a protein called Src42A – which is known to regulate the way actin filaments are organized inside cells – accumulates at these junctions . Excessive Src42A activity in tracheal cells alters the networks of actin filaments and disrupts the formation of the matrix . Öztürk-Çolak et al . also find evidence of a “feedback” mechanism , in which the presence of chitin reduces the activity of Src42A to maintain the correct patterning of actin . These findings reveal that actin and junctions between cells play a central role in co-ordinating the formation of the extracellular matrix in fruit fly airways . The next challenge will be to understand which proteins and other molecules are involved in the process that allows the extracellular matrix to communicate with the cells ."," When cells grow and multiply, they often stick to each other via special molecules called adhesion molecules. Adhesion between cells is very important for building tissues and organs. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cells communicate with each other and how this communication affects the way cells interact with each others. They looked at a kind of adhesive molecule called integrin, which is made up of two parts called alpha and beta. Integrins play an important part in making connections between cells and the surrounding material that makes up tissues. There are several different kinds of integrins, and they are named depending on which alpha and which beta part they have. One particular type of integrin is called alphaPS1beta1, and it is usually found in cells that make up the heart, muscles, skin, bones, and blood vessels. The researchers discovered that alphaPS2beta1 is also found in the cells of the trout gills. They found that alphaVbeta3 is mostly found in brain cells. The scientists learned that the different types of integrines connect to different materials outside of the cell. For instance, alphaVβ3 binds to collagen, which gives strength to bones and skin. AlphaPS1β1 binds mainly to fibronectin, a substance that helps keep muscle cells attached to each others and to the material outside of them. The authors suggest that the way integrins work together with other molecules determines how strong the connection between cells are. This means that different combinations of integrine types give cells different ways of sticking to things. The results of this study will help scientists learn more details about how different molecules work together to build tissues in different parts of the body. Understanding how cells talk to each and how those conversations affect how cells stick to things will help doctors figure out new treatments for diseases that affect how people move and feel."
"Should you go for coffee with Jules , or go to the movie theater with Jim ? Both options require you to make additional decisions , for example , which café would you go to , or what movie could you see ? Many of the decisions we make in our daily lives feature a number of sub-decisions . Many of our day-to-day decisions have multiple layers of sub-decisions embedded within them that are not necessarily independent . Our opinions of the cafés in town and the movies showing at the theater may influence our decision over whom to spend the afternoon with . In 2015 , researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience performed experiments in macaques to try to work out how the brain makes these decisions . The monkeys learned to choose between two visual stimuli ( decision 1 ) . The outcome of decision 1 determined whether the animals then had to make decision 2 or decision 3 . The results suggested that the monkeys initially made all three comparisons independently and in parallel , before combining the evidence to select their overall strategy . This process is referred to as hierarchical decision-making . In the original analogy , one would compare the relative merits of Jules versus Jim , café A versus café B , and a horror movie versus a comedy at the same time before deciding what to do . Other researchers have now reanalyzed the data from the original work using new computer simulations . This second analysis suggests that the results are more consistent with an alternative model of decision-making called a flat model , in which the brain compares all of the final options simultaneously ( Jules + café A; Jules + café B; Jim + horror movie; Jim + comedy ) before making a decision . In response to these findings , Zylberberg et al . – who conducted the work reported in 2015 – reanalyzed the original data and re-ran the simulations . Zylberberg et al . argue that the flat model provides a poor fit to the original data . A new experiment with human volunteers suggests that modifying the task by adding even more decisions can lead to the different comparisons being made one after the other ( in series ) rather than all at the same time ( in parallel ) , before the decision is made . This is difficult to explain with a flat model . Zylberberg et al . argue that these findings confirm the original conclusion that the monkeys use a hierarchical strategy . Moreover , the new results expose a previously unknown limit in the number of decisions that the brain can evaluate at any one time . If this limit is exceeded , decision-making becomes serial . Future studies can build on these findings by further exploring the limits of parallel decision-making , which may help us to understand how the brain is able to make multiple decisions while keeping the future consequences in mind ."," When people make decisions, they usually consider options carefully before choosing the best one. But sometimes, people must decide between multiple options without knowing exactly what each option entails. Such decisions involve ""higher"" and ""lower"" levels of thinking. Researchers recently developed a way to test how people solve these kinds of decisions using brain imaging techniques. They found that people integrate information about the options at different levels simultaneously until deciding which option is best. Then, they used computer simulations to confirm that this kind of decision‐making process works. Their findings provide insights into how our brains think through complex situations. Further studies are needed to understand why and when we use this type of decision processing. This knowledge could lead to ways to improve our decision‐makers' abilities. For instance, training people to think at multiple levels could help them make better decisions. Also, developing tools that help people weigh their options at each level could aid them in making informed decisions. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the decision‐processing methods our brains use. With additional research, scientists could potentially devise interventions to help people make smarter decisions. This could benefit everyone from individuals to organizations and governments. As technology advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to predict how people will react to emerging issues. Decision‐making skills that incorporate multiple perspectives could help address some of today's pressing challenges. For example, climate change poses significant risks to humanity, requiring policymakers to balance economic costs against environmental protection. Developing effective solutions to such global concerns necessitates careful consideration of competing priorities and potential consequences. Effective decision‐maker training programs could equip people with the tools they need to tackle these issues effectively. Ultimately, this work contributes to our understanding of the decision processes underlying human behaviors. By gaining insight into how people arrive at conclusions, we can design interventions that promote rational judgment and wise decision‐makings."
"Many things in the world have a certain structure to them , which we can use to organize our thinking . To mentally represent your family , for example , you could group your family members into men and women , or group them based on where they live . But a more intuitive approach for most people is to organize family members by generation: child , sibling , parent , grandparent . It is as though we instinctively place each family member along a mental line , from young to old . We use mental lines to organize other types of information too , most notably numbers . But can we also use them to represent new information ? Luyckx et al . trained healthy volunteers to associate pictures of six different colored donkeys with six different reward probabilities . One donkey was followed by reward 5% of the time , another was followed by reward 95% of the time , and so on . Through trial and error , the volunteers learned to rank the donkeys in terms of how likely they were to precede a reward . Luyckx et al . then compared the volunteers’ brain activity while viewing the donkeys to their brain activity while viewing the numbers 1 to 6 . The donkeys evoked patterns of electrical brain activity corresponding to the number that signaled their place on a mental line . Thus , donkey 1 , with the lowest reward probability , produced a pattern of brain activity similar to that of the number 1 , and so on for the others . This suggests that rather than learning in an unstructured way , we use past knowledge of relations among stimuli to organize new information . This phenomenon is called structural alignment . The results of Luyckx et al . provide the first evidence from brain activity to support structural alignment . They suggest that we use a general understanding of how the world is structured to learn new things . This could be relevant to both education and artificial intelligence . People , and computers , may learn more effectively if taught about the relations between items , rather than just the items in isolation .","People can learn about things even when they don’t know exactly what they are looking at. For example, you can probably tell if something is bigger or smaller just by seeing the pattern of shapes around it. Scientists call this idea “magnitude.” Magnitudes can be thought of as being on a straight line, where everything goes from really big on the left side to really small on the right side. People can think about magnitudes using words (“big,” “medium,” “small”) or pictures (“➕” means “larger” and “➖” means ”smaller”). Sometimes, though, it’s hard to figure out what something is without knowing its exact size. So, scientists wanted to find out if there was a special place in the brain where people store ideas about magnitutes. To do this, they asked people to look at different symbols that told them how big something was going to be. While people looked at these symbols, the scientists used special equipment to watch what was happening in people’s brains. Later, the people saw other symbols that gave them hints about how much money they would get from choosing certain objects. Some of these objects were worth a lot of money, some were worth medium amounts, and others weren’t worth anything at all. The scientists found that people’ s brains responded differently depending on how much they liked the object they were thinking about picking. Importantly, the way people’ ss brains responded matched the amount of money people expected to win. This finding suggests that people stored information about magnudes in their brains in the same way they store information about how likely it is that they will win money. Just like before, though, sometimes the scientists found patterns in the data that made sense. Other times, though —like when they tried to figure exactly where in the person’ s brain they found the information—they couldn’ t explain what happened. That means we still have a lot to learn about how our brains help us make decisions!"
"Salmonellae are a group of bacteria that can cause vomiting and diarrhea if we consume contaminated food . Once in the bowel , the bacteria get inside our cells , where they stay in a compartment called the vacuole . This environment is very acidic , and the inside of the microbes also becomes more acidic in response . This change helps Salmonella to switch on genes that allow them to survive and infect humans , but it is still unclear how this mechanism takes place . To investigate this question , Liew , Foo et al . harnessed a recent technique called super-resolution imaging , which lets scientists see individual molecules in a cell . First , the technique was used to count a protein called SsrB as well as the enzyme that activates it , SsrA . The role of SsrB is to bind to DNA and turn on genes involved in making proteins that help Salmonella thrive . These studies revealed that the levels of SsrA/B proteins increased three-fold in an acidic environment . Then , Liew , Foo et al . followed SsrB inside cells , knowing that fast-moving particles are free in solution , while slow-moving particles are typically bound to DNA . In acidic conditions , the proportion of SsrB bound to DNA doubled . Finally , further experiments revealed that when the environment was acidic , SsrB became five times more likely to bind to DNA . Taken together , the results suggest that acidic conditions trigger a cascade of events which switch on genetic information that allows Salmonella to survive . If SsrB could be prevented from responding to acid stress , it could potentially stop Salmonella from surviving inside host cells . This knowledge should be applied to drive new treatment strategies for Salmonella and other microbes that infect human cells ."," When Salmonela bacteria enter a cell, they find themselves in a compartment where the pH is very low. Low pH activates a mechanism that makes them sicker and more aggressive. Now, scientists have figured out how this activation happens. It turns out that when the p H gets lower, some special proteins start working differently. This means that doctors could potentially come up with medicines that stop these proteins from changing, thus preventing Salmonellas from becoming mean and nasty. That way, patients who eat Salmonelas won’t get sick as badly. Knowing more about how these proteINS work also tells us more about why certain chemicals help Salmonelle survive in harsh conditions. Understanding this can help us figure out new ways to treat diseases caused by Salmonelles. For example, researchers are trying to use similar methods to fight cancer. So, even though Salmonells aren’t nice, learning more about them could actually help save lives! Scientists used really high-tech cameras to watch individual Salmoneles and saw them behaving differently depending on whether the pHP was low or high. Then, they did lots of tests to learn more details about what was happening. Finally, they put everything together to come up wit hthe answer! Cool! Science is awesome! And now you know something new! Yay! Science rules!!! (Sorry, we got carried away there.) (End scene). (Note: Transition music should play during the entire summary.)

"Cancers develop when cells in the body divide rapidly in an uncontroled manner . It is generally possible to cure cancers that remain contained within a small area . However , if the tumor cells start to move , the cancer may spread in the body and become life threatening . Currently , most of the anti-cancer treatments act to reduce the multiplication of these cells , but not their ability to migrate . A signal protein called Ras stimulates human cells to grow and move around . In healthy cells , the activity of Ras is tightly controled to ensure cells only divide and migrate at particular times , but in roughly 30% of all human cancers , Ras is abnormally active . Ras switches on another protein , named RalB , which is also involved in inappropriate cell migration . Yet , it is not clear how RalB is capable to help Ras trigger the migration of cells . Zago et al . used an approach called optogenetics to specifically activate the RalB protein in human cells using a laser that produces blue light . When activated , the light-controlled RalB started abnormal cell migration; this was used to dissect which molecules and mechanisms were involved in the process . Taken together , the experiments showed that , first , Ras ‘turns on’ RalB by changing the location of two proteins that control RalB . Then , the activated RalB regulates the exocyst , a group of proteins that travel within the cell . In turn , the exocyst recruits another group of proteins , named the Wave complex , which is part of the molecular motor required for cells to migrate . Zago et al . also found that , in patients , the RalB protein was present at abnormally high levels in samples of breast cancer cells that had migrated to another part of the body . Overall , these findings indicate that the role of RalB protein in human cancers is larger than previously thought , and they highlight a new pathway that could be a target for new anti-cancer drugs ."," Researchers have discovered that a special kind of protein called RAL helps cancer cells grow and spread. They think that RAL works by helping the cells make little finger-like structures that let the cells push themselves forward. They know that RAS is a bad protein that causes cancer, and that it makes RAL work. They also know that a group of chemicals called RGL stops RAL from working. They want to find ways to stop RAL and RGS from working together so that the cells cannot grow and move around. They looked at how well RAL worked in 480 different kinds of breast cancer. They saw that RALE worked best in the worst types of breast caner. They hope that finding ways to prevent RALB from working might help treat breast cancer. It is good because it means that doctors might be able to find a way to stop cancer cells from growing and spreading. It is bad because it might mean that people get sick. It might also mean that doctors have to give people extra medicine to fix problems caused by stopping RAL. It means that researchers learned more about why cancer happens. It also means that they might be closer to figuring out how to cure cancer. It gives people hope that they can figure out how cancer happens and what to do about it. It lets people know that they should keep trying to find answers. It tells people that they shouldn’t give up on finding ways of curing cancer. 1) What is the main topic? The main topic is a kind of cancer called breast cancer and how it grows and moves around. 2) Who is affected by this topic? Breast cancer affects women. Sometimes men also get breast cancer, but it is rare. 3) Why is this topic important? This topic is important because it helps doctors learn more about what causes breast cancer to happen and how to possibly find ways of treating it. 4) How does this topic relate to you personally? This article relates to you because it talks about things that happen inside your body. It explains how your body fights against things like germs and cancer. That is important for everyone who has a body! 5) Can you relate to someone else who is affected? Yes, my mom got breast cancer too.

"Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells . It forms networks of filaments that provide structural support and generate the forces needed for cell movement , division , and many other processes in cells . Filaments of actin continuously change in length as actin molecules are added or removed at the ends . One end of an actin filament—called the barbed-end—grows much faster than the other , known as the pointed-end . Many other proteins also help the actin filaments to form . Some of these proteins bind to the ends of the filaments , where they directly control the growth of the filaments . Other proteins bind along the length of the filaments , but how these ‘side-binding’ proteins influence the growth of filaments is not clear . In this study , Crevenna et al . used a technique called ‘total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy’ to study how several side-binding proteins affect the growth of actin filaments in an artificial system . The growth of the barbed-ends was strongly influenced by which side-binding protein was interacting with the filament . For example , the barbed-end grew rapidly when a protein called VASP was present but grew more slowly in the presence of the protein α-actinin . Although the growth at the pointed-end was generally slow and sporadic , the side-binding proteins also had noticeable effects . Crevenna et al . found that when the side-binding proteins were present at low levels , filament growth was similar for all proteins studied . It was only when the proteins were present at higher levels that the growth of the actin filaments was altered depending on the specific side-binding protein present . One side-binding protein called α-actinin also altered the shape of the actin filament so that when it was present at high levels , the filaments curved in a particular direction . Together , these results suggest that the growth , structure , and flexibility of actin filaments can be strongly influenced by the various proteins that bind along the length of the filaments . The next challenges are to understand the precise details of how these side-binding proteins are able to alter the growth and shape of actin and investigate how they influence other processes that control the structure of actin networks in cells .","There are two ends of a strand of actins, called “barbed” and “pointed”. Actins grow longer by adding monomers to the free end of the actin chain. There are several ways to change the speed of growing actins. Some things that affect the growth include the temperature, the amount of energy available, and the presence or absence of certain chemicals. Scientists know some of the reasons why the growth speeds differ. For instance, the faster growth comes from having fewer actins attached to the end of existing chains. But scientists still don’t fully understand how much each thing affects the growth speed. In this article, scientists looked at how the growth changes when something else is attached to an actin. They found that even though the attachment slows down the growth, the growth is still faster than it would be without the attachment. They think this happens because the attachment makes the actins bend differently. This gives us a better idea of how different things can cause the actinis to grow slower or faster. Knowing this might help doctors figure out ways to treat diseases caused by problems with actins growing too fast or too slow. And knowing this might also help scientists build machines that use actins to do useful work. That kind of machine needs actins that grow at exactly the right speed. Understanding how to change actin growth speeds is also interesting in itself! Because actins are really important for lots of different things in our bodies, like moving ourselves or keeping our skin smooth, understanding actins is very important! And because actins look pretty cool, learning more about them is fun too! 1)What problem does the scientist want to solve?Scientists want to learn more about how actins work.Actins are important for many different things, including helping keep our skin soft and making muscles move. So, scientists want to know more about actins because that might help them come up with ideas for treating diseases or building robots.2)Why is it important?It isn’t really explained here.But it is important because actin is important for all kinds of things.3)Who did it?Dr. Yuan, Dr. Pollard, and Dr. Moormann.4)Where did it happen?At the University of California, Berkeley.5)When did it take place?From January 2nd, 2O19 to June 29th, 3O18.6)How did they do it?They"
"The body produces proteins by transcribing DNA ( genes ) to make messenger RNA , which is then translated to make a protein . Transcription begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA and catalyzes the process by which genetic information from the double helix is copied to a complementary RNA transcript , which subsequently becomes the messenger RNA . Because a living cell usually contains only one or a few copies ( alleles ) of a given gene , molecular fluctuations play a crucial role in cellular transcription . Therefore , studying transcription kinetics at the level of single molecules may provide critical insights into how cells deal with—or even take advantage of—molecular fluctuations . A number of different single-molecule techniques can be used to follow transcription , but these techniques are often relatively slow compared to transcription in living cells , or they suffer from other problems such as only being able to study one step in the transcription process . Now , Zhang , Revyakin et al . have systematically devised a technique called ‘fastFISH’ that is fast enough to track the production of single RNA molecules directly and instantaneously . FastFISH builds on an existing technique called FISH—short for fluorescence in situ hybridization—in which fluorescent molecules are attached to single strands of DNA or RNA . These single strands pair with specific regions of complementary DNA or RNA molecules , and they can be visualized with a fluorescence microscope . However , conventional FISH is a ‘snap-shot’ technique that is not suitable for making real-time observations under physiological conditions . FastFISH relies on single strands of fluorescently labeled DNA and RNA that bind to complementary strands of DNA or RNA extremely quickly , even under physiological conditions , because they contain only three of the four ‘regular’ nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA . As a proof of principle , Zhang , Revyakin et al . used fastFISH to study the kinetics of transcription by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and were able to measure multiple stages of the transcription cycle in a single-molecule experimental setup . By allowing each stage of transcription to be tracked in real-time at the level of single-molecules , fastFISH will permit a more in-depth analysis of the factors that regulate how genes are expressed as proteins in our cells . Moreover , the ability to design single-strand probes that bind rapidly to DNA and RNA targets could have many additional applications , including new strategies for more efficient gene silencing ."," Transcription is a process in which a piece of DNA is copied into a type of molecule called RNA. This copying happens in small bursts, rather than continuously. Each burst produces a little bit of RAN. Because there are lots of copies of DNA, even though the bursts are small, there are always some bits of RAND being made. Sometimes, the burst size is big enough to make more than one bit ofRAN. Sometimes it isn’t. The burst size depends on something called the initiation rate, which is like the number of times the machine that does the copying starts working in a certain amount of time. Researchers wanted to know how much the inititation rate affects the burst sizes. They came up with a clever way to measure burst sizes by using tiny pieces of DNA that light up when they bind to RNA, and looking at how bright the dots get before they fade away again. By changing the initition rate, they saw that bigger burst sizes happened when the inition rate was higher. That means that the initation rate really does affect burst sizes! They also looked at how quickly the burst happens once the machine starts working. They found that the faster the machine works, the shorter the burst lasts. Finally, they looked at when the machine stops working. Once again, they found that how quickly it works affected when it stopped. All of this helps us learn more about how the transciption process works. Knowing how fast it goes, and how big the burst are, could help doctors figure out if things are going wrong in the body. It could also help us come up with better medicines to treat those things. And knowing how often it stops could help us understand how cells decide to make different kinds of molecules. That would be super helpful! We don’t know why the machine sometimes speeds up and slows down, but this research gives us clues to help us figure it out."
"Cells switch their genes on or off in order to respond to changes in their environment . A group of proteins called histones are partly responsible for regulating gene activity . Like all proteins , histones are made from smaller building blocks called amino acids . Enzymes can chemically modify specific amino acids in histone proteins , which allows the histones to switch nearby genes on or off . One of these modifications is called methylation , and the methylation of specific “lysine” amino acids in histone proteins regulates gene activity in different ways . Previous research has shown that , in certain types of cancer cells , lysines that can be methylated are often replaced with another amino acid , a methionine . These substitutions stop the histones from correctly controlling the activity of nearby genes because methionine cannot be methylated like lysine . Additionally , even if only a small number of histones have methionine in place of lysine , this change can have a widespread effect because the few histones with the methionine can block other histones from being methylated too . However , previous studies did not provide a clear mechanism for why this is the case . In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe an enzyme called Clr4 methylates a histone protein at a lysine named H3K9 . Now , Shan , Wang , Xu et al . show that substituting this lysine with a methionine ( referred to as H3K9M ) stops the widespread methylation of histones by trapping the Clr4 enzyme . Specifically , Clr4 becomes stuck to the H3K9M histones , and is therefore unable to modify any other histones . Shan et al . went on to carry out a more detailed study of the structure of H3K9M attached to another enzyme called G9a . This enzyme is found in human cells and is similarly inhibited by H3K9M . This investigation identified additional chemical interactions that explain why Clr4 and G9a become trapped by the H3K9M histone but not by normal histones . Future studies are needed to explore whether other altered histones are able to trap enzymes in the way that H3K9M traps Clr4 and G9a . In addition , this work could eventually lead to new cancer therapies ."," When cells divide, they need to replicate their genetic material and then separate into two new daughter cells. Before dividing completely, the two daughter cells remain physically attached by a narrow piece of material called the spindle. During this stage, the cells prepare for separation by forming a special kind of membraneless organelle called a midbody at the center of the spondle. Midbods contain small particles called vesicles that are made from lipids and proteins ; these vesicle play important roles in cell division. One of the functions of midbody vesicular is to ensure that the newly separated daughter cells inherit equal amounts of genetic material. Recent studies have shown that midbody-derived vesicals may also be involved in controlling the amount of genetic information that is passed down from parent to daughter cells during normal cell growth. Vesicles are produced by a process called budding, in which a small section of the membrane detaches from the main organelle and forms a smaller vesical. Budding usually takes place at the edge of the midboby, but sometimes it can happen anywhere else in the cell. It is thought that budding plays a crucial role in maintaining the proper size and shape of the cell by helping to redistribute materials throughout the cellular interior. By studying the process of budding in detail, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how cells maintain their proper size, shape, and organization. This knowledge could ultimately help us develop new treatments for diseases caused by defects in cellular organization, such as cancer. Overall, the study of buddying in midbobies could provide valuable insights into fundamental aspects of cell biology and potentially lead to new therapies for various diseases. In this article, the authors describe a new method for visualizing and tracking midbody membranes in living cells. They used this approach to discover that a protein called septin 7 plays a critical role in controlling budding during cellular division. Specifically, they found that septin7 is required to initiate budding and that it helps to direct the formation and movement of vesials away from the midzone. Without septin, budding does not take place properly and the cells experience problems with cell division and growth. The findings presented in this article highlight the importance of septin proteins for proper cell division. Understanding how septin and other related proteins control budding could lead to novel therapeutics for treating diseases caused or exacerbated by"
"In animals , an enzyme known as RNA polymerase II ( Pol II for short ) is a key element of the transcription process , whereby the genetic information contained in DNA is turned into messenger RNA molecules in the cells , which can then be translated to proteins . To perform this task , Pol II needs to be activated by a complex of proteins called P-TEFb; however , P-TEFb is usually found in an inactive form held by another group of proteins . Yet , it is unclear how P-TEFb is released and allowed to activate Pol II . Scientists have speculated that another protein called JMJD6 ( Jumonji domain-containing 6 ) is important for P-TEFb to activate Pol II . Various roles for JMJD6 have been proposed , but its exact purpose remains unclear . Recently , two enzymes closely related to JMJD6 were found to be able to make precise cuts in other proteins; Lee , Liu et al . therefore wanted to test whether this is also true of JMJD6 . Experiments using purified JMJD6 showed that it could make a cut in an enzyme called MePCE , which belongs to the group of proteins that hold P-TEFb in its inactive form . Lee , Liu et al . then tested the relationships between these proteins in living human and mouse cells . The levels of activated Pol II were lower in cells without JMJD6 and higher in those without MePCE . Together , the results suggest that JMJD6 cuts MePCE to release P-TEFb , which then activates Pol II . JMJD6 appears to know where to cut by following a specific pattern of elements in the structure of MePCE . When MePCE was mutated so that the pattern changed , JMJD6 was unable to cut it . These results suggest that JMJD6 and related enzymes belong to a new family of proteases , the molecular scissors that can cleave other proteins . The molecules that regulate transcription often are major drug targets , for example in the fight against cancer . Ultimately , understanding the role of JMJD6 might help to identify new avenues for cancer drug development ."," Researchers have studied a protein called JMID6, which helps to turn on genes in cells. To learn more about how JMDI6 works, the researchers made a version of JMD6 that could easily be turned on or off. Using this tool, the team learned that JMDS6 helps to break apart a group of proteins, called 7KS snRNA complex, that keeps another group of protein, called P-TFb, from helping to turn genes on. Normally, P-FTf is attached to DNA, but when the 3KS snRP complex breaks apart, PFTb can attach to DNA and start making proteins. The researchers think that JMI6 might help to pick apart the 2KS snRA complex. If this is right, then JMJS6 would help to keep genes turned off unless they are supposed to be turned. Understanding how JMDJ6 works could help doctors find better ways to treat diseases caused by too little or too much gene activity. For example, doctors could find ways to turn JMDJs on or JMDjs off to fix problems with gene activity in patients. Doctors could also look for drugs that work like JMDJS to treat conditions caused by problems with genes. Finally, understanding how JDMJs work could tell us more about why living things make and need so many different kinds of proteinsthey could help them do exactly what they need to do, when they need todo it. That means that learning about proteins like JMIDs could teach us moreabout how life works. The authors of this article want to share their ideas about JMids with other scientists who study proteins and how they work. They hope that other scientists will read their ideas and try to figure out how to use them to learn moreabout proteinsand how theywork. Other scientists might come up with ways to use JMJs that are differentfrom the waysthat the authors of thistudy came up with. That would mean that everyone won! Everyone gets to learn about proteinsthereare lots of ways touse them, and maybe even somethingspecialthat nobody thought of before."
"Sexual reproduction – that is , the combination of sex cells from two different individuals to produce an embryo – is one of the many mechanisms that have evolved to maintain genetic diversity . Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , with each chromosome in a pair carrying either a paternal or maternal copy of the same gene . To form an embryo with the right number of chromosomes , each sex cell ( the egg or sperm cell ) must only contain one chromosome from each pair . Sex cells are produced from parent cells containing two sets of paternal and maternal chromosomes: these cells then divide twice to form four sex cells which contain only one chromosome from each pair . Before the parent cell divides , a process known as ‘recombination’ takes place , which allows chromosomes in a pair to exchange bits of genetic information . This reshuffling ensures that each chromosome in a sex cell is unique . A protein called PRDM9 helps control which sections of genetic information are recombined by modifying proteins attached to the chromosomes , marking them as locations for exchange . The DNA at each of these sites is then broken and repaired using the genetic sequence of the chromosome it is paired with as a template , thus causing the two chromosomes to swap genes . In 2019 , a group of researchers found a set of genes in the testis of mice that are expressed at the same time as the gene for PRDM9 . This suggested that another protein called ZCWPW1 is likely involved in recombination , but the precise role of this protein was unclear . To answer this question , Wells , Bitoun et al . – including many of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – examined human cells grown in the laboratory to determine where ZCWPW1 binds to in the chromosome . This revealed that ZCWPW1 can be found at the same sites as PRDM9 , which is responsible for bringing it there . Furthermore , cells from male mice lacking the gene for ZCWPW1 cannot complete the exchange of genetic information between chromosomes , meaning that the mice are infertile . As such , ZCWPW1 seems to connect location selection by PRDM9 to the DNA repair mechanisms needed for gene exchange between chromosomes . Infertility is a significant issue for humans affecting as many as one in every six couples . Fertility is complex and many of the biological mechanisms involved are not fully understood . This work suggests that both PRDM9 and ZCWPW1 are key to the production of sex cells and may be worth investigating as factors that affect fertility in humans ."," Meiosis is a special type of cell division that occurs in germ cells (egg and sperm) to produce gametes (haploid cells). To make sure that people reproduce normally, the pairs of chromsomes need to line up properly with each other. For this to happen, certain parts of the genes need to be cut and put back together again. Some of these cuts occur randomly, while others occur at specific locations. These specific locations are called ""hot spots"" and they are controlled by a protein called PRDM 9. When PRDM nine is not working correctly, the cuts don't happen at the correct location and the pairs don' t line up correctly. As a result, there are problems with reproduction and some babies won't develop normally. Researchers have found another protein that works with PRMD 9 to help make the cuts at the right places. If this protein doesn't work correctly, there will be the same kind of problems with the lines not forming correctly and some of the babies won’t develop properly. So, even though PRDM NINE and this new protein work together to make the right cuts, if either one isn't working correctly there will still be problems with making babies. This explains why it is very important for these proteins work correctly. They are necessary for making eggs and sperms that can make healthy babies. The researchers think that this protein is important for making the right kinds of cuts in the right locations. But they haven't figured out exactly how it works yet. They hope that studying this protein will teach them more about how eggs and semen are made and maybe find ways to fix problems with fertility. That would be good news for anyone who wants to have children someday. The scientists want to learn more about this protein so they can figure out how to treat people who have problems getting pregnant."
"The genetic material inside cells is often packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes . In humans , mice and other mammals , a pair of sex chromosomes determines the genetic or chromosomal sex of each individual . Those who inherit two “X” chromosomes are said to be chromosomally female , while chromosomal males have one “X” and one “Y” chromosome . This means females have twice as many copies of genes on the X chromosome as a male does , which turns out to be double the number that the body needs . To solve this problem , mammals have developed a strategy known as dosage compensation . The second X chromosome in females becomes “silent”: its DNA remains unchanged , but none of the genes are active . A long noncoding RNA molecule called Xist is responsible for switching off the extra X genes in female cells . It does this by coating the entirety of the second X chromosome . Normally , RNA molecules transmit the coded instructions in genes to the cellular machinery that manufactures proteins . “Noncoding” RNAs like Xist , however , are RNAs that have taken on different jobs inside the cell . Researchers believe that the ancestral Xist gene may have once encoded a protein but changed over time to produce only a noncoding RNA . Carter , Xu et al . therefore set out to find out how exactly this might have happened , and also how Xist might have acquired its ability to switch genes off . Initial experiments used mouse cells grown in the laboratory , in which a protein called Spen was deleted . Spen is known to help Xist silence the X chromosome . In female cells lacking Spen , the second X chromosome remained active . Other chromosomes in male and female cells also had stretches of DNA that became active upon Spen’s removal . These DNA sequences , termed endogenous retroviruses , were remnants of ancestral viral infections . In other words , Spen normally acted as an antiviral defense . Analysis of genetic sequences showed that Spen recognized endogenous retrovirus sequences resembling a key region in Xist , a region which was needed for Xist to work properly . Inserting fragments of endogenous retroviruses into a defective version of Xist lacking this region also partially restored its ability to inactivate genes , suggesting that X chromosome silencing might work by hijacking cellular defenses against viruses . That is , female cells essentially ‘pretend’ there is a viral infection on the second X chromosome by coating it with Xist ( which mimics endogenous retroviruses ) , thus directing Spen to shut it down . This research is an important step towards understanding how female cells carry out dosage compensation in mammals . More broadly , it sheds new light on how ancient viruses may have shaped the evolution of noncoding RNAs in the human genome ."," Scientists have learned that when some viruses invade a cell, they use special pieces of their own RNA called ""long non-coding RNAS"" (lncRNAS) to trick the cell into making copies of themselves. One type of lnc RNA does this by sticking to another kind of protein called SPEN. When SPEN is attached to the lnc-RNA, it helps the cell copy itself. But sometimes, the lncs-RNas get stuck to SPEN too tightly, so the cell cannot make enough copies of itself. Researchers think that this might happen during something called ""sex chromosomes inactivations"". During this event, the female version of a chromosone called the ""X chromosones"" gets turned off inside the egg cell. They think that maybe the lns-RNSs stick to SPENS too tight, so that the egg cannot make copies of themself. To test this idea, researchers made a piece of artificial RNA that looked like part of the X chromsome. Then they saw what happened when they gave this piece of RNA, along with SPEN, to eggs. They found that SPEN helped the eggs make copies. Also, they found that when they took away the part of RNS that looks like the X-chromosome, the eggs did not make copies very well. So, they think that the X RNA might get stuck too tightly to SPEND, so it turns off the X chomosome. Overall, this research suggests that SPEND might help keep the X Chromosone turned off. This might explain why females have only half as many copies of the genes on the X as males. And since having extra copies of some genes on X causes problems, turning off one copy might be a good thing. More research needs to be done to figure out exactly how SPEN and the X gene work together."
"The immune system is composed of many types of cells that can recognize foreign molecules and pathogens so they can eliminate them . When cells in the body become infected with a pathogen , they can process the pathogen’s proteins and present them on their own surface . Specialized immune cells can then recognize infected cells and interact with them , forming an ‘immunological synapse’ . These synapses play an important role in immune response: they activate the immune system and allow it to kill harmful cells . To form an immunological synapse , an immune cell must reorganize its internal contents , including an aster-shaped scaffold made of tiny protein tubes called microtubules . The center of this scaffold moves towards the immunological synapse as it forms . This re-orientation of the microtubules towards the immunological synapse is known as 'polarization' and it happens very rapidly , but it is not yet clear how it works . One molecule involved in the polarization process is called KIF21B , a protein that can walk along microtubules , building up at the ends and affecting their growth . Whether KIF21B makes microtubules grow more quickly , or more slowly , is a matter of debate , and the impact microtubule length has on immunological synapse formation is unknown . Here , Hooikaas , Damstra et al . deleted the gene for KIF21B from human immune cells called T cells to find out how it affected their ability to form an immunological synapse . Without KIF21B , the T cells grew microtubules that were longer than normal , and had trouble forming immunological synapses . When the T cells were treated with a drug that stops microtubule growth , their ability to form immunological synapses was restored , suggesting a role for KIF21B . To explore this further , Hooikaas , Damstra et al . replaced the missing KIF21B gene with a gene that coded for a version of the protein that could be seen using microscopy . This revealed that , when KIF21B reaches the ends of microtubules , it stops their growth and triggers their disassembly . Computational modelling showed that cells find it hard to reorient their microtubule scaffolding when the individual tubes are too long . It only takes a small number of KIF21B molecules to shorten the microtubules enough to allow the center of the scaffold to move . Research has linked the KIF21B gene to autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis . Microtubules also play an important role in cell division , a critical process driving all types of cancer . Drugs that affect microtubule growth are already available , and a deeper understanding of KIF21B and microtubule regulation in immune cells could help to improve treatments in the future ."," When immune cells come into contact with infected cells, they need to quickly change their internal organization to attack the infection. To do this, they rely on something called the ""immunological"" synapse, which is like a bridge connecting the two cells. Inside the immune cell, tiny hair-like structures called micro-tube help organize the cell contents. During an immune response, these micro-structures must be carefully adjusted to keep the immune system organized. Scientists recently discovered that a specific kind of micro-structure called a centrosphere helps adjust the micro-network during an immune reaction. They also learned that a special kind of protein called kif21b helps control the length and movement of these microtube networks. When kifb21 is missing, the microstructures get too big and the immune cells lose their ability to fight infections. Using computer models, researchers tried to figure out exactly how kiflb21 controls the microstructure movements. Their model suggests that kifbl21 helps limit the length microtuberules and direct them towards the center of the immune response. By doing this, kifl21 makes space for the centromere to move closer to the front of the immunity response. Overall, these studies show that controlling the length, direction, and location of microstructural changes is very important for the immune responses to work effectively. Future studies should try to learn more about how kiff21 works and how it affects the immune systems of people who suffer from autoimmunity diseases. This knowledge will hopefully lead to new ways to treat these conditions. Researchers should also try to see if kiffl21 can be used to improve treatments for other diseases involving abnormal microtublular arrangements. For instance, many types of cancer involve aberrations in microtubble arrangement. Understanding how kff21 affects microtuler behavior could help doctors develop new drugs to fix these problems."
"A nematode worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans is often used in the laboratory to study how animals grow and develop . There are two types of C . elegans worm: hermaphrodite individuals produce both female sex cells ( eggs ) and male sex cells ( sperm ) , while male individuals only produce sperm . The hermaphrodite worms are able to reproduce without mating with another worm , allowing populations of C . elegans to grow rapidly when they are living in favorable conditions . However , when the hermaphrodites do mate with males they tend to produce more offspring . These offspring are also usually healthier because they receive a mixture of genetic material from two different parents . Although mating is beneficial for the survival of a species it can also harm an individual animal . Previous studies have shown that mating with male worms can accelerate aging of hermaphrodite worms and cause premature death . However , it remained unclear whether hermaphrodite worms have evolved any mechanisms to protect themselves after mating with a male . To address this question , Booth et al . used genetic techniques to study the lifespans of hermaphrodite worms . The experiments found that the hermaphrodites’ own sperm ( known as self-sperm ) regulated a sperm-sensing signaling pathway that protected them from the negative impact of mating with males . Hermaphrodites with self-sperm that mated with males lived for a similar length of time as hermaphrodites that did not mate . On the other hand , hermaphrodites that did not have self-sperm ( because they were older or had a genetic mutation ) had shorter lifespans after mating than worms that did not mate . Modulating the sperm-sensing signaling pathway in worms that lacked self-sperm was sufficient to protect them from the negative effects of mating with males . Further experiments found that the hermaphrodites of another nematode worm called C . briggsae – which evolved self-sperm independently of C . elegans – also protected themselves from the negative effects of mating with males in a similar way . This suggests that other animals may also have evolved similar mechanisms to protect themselves from harm when mating . A separate study by Shi et al . has found that the beneficial effects of self-sperm are mediated by a pathway linked to longevity that also exists in mammals . The results of both investigations combined suggest possible avenues for future research into the complex relationship between health , longevity , and reproduction ."," When hermaphdritic Caenorhabditis elegans worms meet males, they often die sooner than expected. Some scientists think that this behavior is good for the worms because it prevents them from spending energy on producing offspring with males who carry bad genes. They call this strategy ""self-fertilization"". Others think that the worm should try to mate with males anyway, even though it will sometimes fail. They say that trying to mate is still worthwhile because sometimes the worm wins and gets to reproduce. Now, researchers have discovered that the decision to avoid males or not depends on what kind of worms are around. Young worms that haven't yet tried to mate are usually safe from dying earlier. That's because they have something inside them called ""self sperm"". Self sperm let young worms survive even if they don't mate with a male. Older worms don' t have any self sperm left, so they need to mate to survive. Researchers also learned that having self sperms is not enough. There needs to be another special thing happening inside the young worm that lets them ignore males. Scientists know that one reason why young worm ignore males is because they sense the sperm inside them. So, they tested if adding sperm to old worms would make them live longer. Adding sperm did not help the old worm live longer. Instead, adding sperns made the old womrs behave like young ones again! They ignored males and lived longer. This shows that young worm feel the sperma inside them and ignore males. Old worms probably don' feel the self spert anymore, so even if the added extra sperm, they still notice males and die faster. The researchers also looked at how the spt got into the young womrs in the frist place. They found that a certain gene helped move the spts into the places where they can make young worm sense them. Then, they checked if this gene was turned on or off in old worm. They saw that the gene was not turned on in old womrks. Finally, they looked at what kinds of things happen inside worms when they sense sperm. They noticed that some things happened in the intestine. Also, they saw that some genes that help worms deal with stress were turned on. All of these findings show that young and old worm behave differently depending on what happens inside them. Sometimes, being young is the best choice, and"
"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It is currently the leading cause of death by a single microbe worldwide , claiming the lives of 1 . 5 million people annually . The disease is difficult to cure , as many strains of the bacterium have developed resistance to the main drugs used to treat the infection . This leaves physicians with few options to treat tuberculosis and control its spread . The spread of these drug-resistant strains is a major global public health problem . New strategies that do not lead to drug resistance are needed . One possibility would be to starve the bacterium . Like all living things , M . tuberculosis must eat to survive and spread . Right now , scientists do not know much about how this microbe eats . However , they do know that it needs nitrogen – an essential part of DNA , RNA , and proteins – to survive . Most bacteria like to consume ammonium as their main nitrogen source , but they may also use select amino acids as a nitrogen source . Now , Agapova et al . show that M . tuberculosis is not a picky eater . In the experiments , the bacteria were fed different nitrogen sources . Then , they tracked how well the bacteria grew . The experiments showed that M . tuberculosis happily eats many different amino acids and may use more than one as a nitrogen source at a time . It does not tightly control its stockpile of nitrogen sources the way other bacteria do , or use ammonium very efficiently . This suggests that M . tuberculosis has evolved to be very flexible in its dietary habits , which may explain why these bacteria can thrive in the varied environments within the human body . Knowing exactly how M . tuberculosis acquires and uses nitrogen may help scientists design ways to thwart the process and starve the bacteria ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about how Mycolicibacterium smegmaticells use different kinds of nitrogengroups to grow and survive. They discovered that thecells don’t keep track of how muchof each kind of nitrongroupthey make. Also, thecellsdid not prefer any particularkind of nitrgrouptothe others. Furthermore,thecellsused the nitrogroupto make things they neededmore than if they just used ammonia.Finally, scientists learned that a specialenzyme called “ald” helped themuse alaninenitrogen groups to survivebetter in places where there wasn’t muchfood around. Overall, thescientists figured out that the wayMycolicicibacteriablack people use nitrogen depends on lots of different things, so they might be able to adapt to living in lots of places. This makes Mycolicolicibacters good at making people sick! Because they can figure out ways to live even when there isn’t a lot of food available. This means that doctors need to pay attention towhere patients got sickand what they ateto knowhow to treat them properly.It is interesting to thinkabout how bacteria changewhat foods they eat togetrow faster or slower.

"Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIFs ) are important in animals when the amount of oxygen in the air or water drops . These proteins switch on genes that help cells and tissues adapt to the shortage in oxygen , for example , by stimulating the production of red blood cells . Each HIF is made up of two subunits called α and β that only bind to each other when the oxygen levels drop . This two-subunit complex , or 'dimer' , then activates a set of genes by binding to a stretch of DNA known as the hypoxia response element . HIFs also play important roles in many different stages of animal development . There are many different HIF proteins that are each present at different developmental stages; this has made them difficult to study . Zhang et al . have found a new form of HIF-3α in zebrafish – called Hif-3α2 . The experiments show that this α subunit is not regulated by oxygen , but may still be able to activate genes that have the hypoxia response element . When Hif-3α2 was injected into zebrafish embryos , the body pattern that is normally set up in embryogenesis was disrupted . Further experiments revealed that Hif-3α2 regulates embryo development by destabilizing a protein called β-catenin . This inhibits a cell communication system called Wnt/β-catenin signaling . Zhang et al . also show that the two distinct activities of Hif-3α2 – binding to the hypoxia response element and destabilizing β-catenin – involve two different regions of the protein . Together , Zhang et al . ’s findings show that zebrafish Hif-3α2 combines some conventional features of HIF proteins with a unique developmental role . It is likely that human Hif-3α may also work in a similar way , so future studies will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for these distinct roles ."," Scientists discovered another version of a kind of protein called Hif3alpha, which is called HIf3alpha2. They named this protein because it works even when there isn't enough oxygen around. Normally, Hif alpha proteins help cells deal with low amounts of oxygen. But scientists found that this specific Hifalpha2 protein doesn't really care about the amount of oxygen around and still works even in places where there is lots of oxygen available. To find out what this protein does, the researchers looked at fish eggs and saw that the eggs whose parents didn't make any Hif 3alpha 2 protein grew bigger faster than the eggs that made too much HifAlpha2 protein. Then, the scientists used a tool to cut out the gene for making Hif Alpha2 protein and put it back in again so that the fish would make less of this protein. Fish who made less Hifα2 protein had smaller livers than normal fish. Finally, the scientist learned that the HifAlpa2 protein makes cells respond differently to a kind or radiation called gamma rays. Specifically, the HIfAlpa 2 proteins stop another kind of signal called ""Wnt"" from working properly. So, having too much of this Hif Alpa2 proteintakes away the ability of cells to grow and divide normally. This happens because the Wnt signal tells cells to keep growing and dividing. Without the WNT signal, the cells don't know to keep going, so they stop growing and eventually die. The scientists think that this discovery may help them learn more about why some babies born with liver problems might benefit from getting a dose of gamma ray radiation right after they are born. This treatment might help the baby's liver start to work better. The authors hope that learning more about this protein will help doctors figure out ways to use it to help people get better when they have liver disease."
"Stem cells have the rare ability to divide and specialize into the many different types of cells necessary for an organism to survive . For instance , germ stem cells can multiply to produce precursor cells that go on to become eggs or sperm needed for reproduction . When a stem cell divides , the daughter cells can either remain ‘naïve’ , or start to specialize into a given cell type . In many cases , this decision is strongly influenced by the properties of the environment that surrounds the stem cell . However , in the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans , how the daughters of germ stem cells specialize was thought to be a random process , with nearby cells equally likely to specialize or remain naïve . In this animal , germ stem cells reside in tube-shaped structures called gonads , which are enclosed by a large ‘distal tip’ cell . In addition , cells known as Sh1 surround the gonad . Here , Gordon et al . tracked dividing germ stem cells in the gonads of live worms . This revealed that both the distal tip cell and Sh1 cells have finger-like extensions that form contacts with the germ stem cells . The fate of dividing germ stem cells is shaped by these interactions . If they touch only the distal tip cell , they remain in a naïve state . However , if they contact both the distal tip cell and an Sh1 cell , one daughter of the stem cell becomes an egg precursor – with the daughter closest to the distal tip cell staying naïve . In fact , germ stem cells that are prevented from contacting Sh1 cells divide less often . Many other types of stem cells , for example in human skin , are believed to make the decision to remain naïve or undergo specialization randomly . The results from Gordon et al . could provide a roadmap to discover hidden layers of control in other organisms , some of which may be potentially relevant in health and disease ."," Scientists studied how cells leave their ""nests"" in a tiny worm called C.elegans. They noticed that sometimes, cells come out of their nest in groups instead of alone. They also noticed that these groups always came out of a specific side of the nest. They think that this special place helps the cells get ready to leave their nest. Then, they looked closely at this special spot and found that there was a nearby cell that seemed to help the leaving cells. Finally, they found that this helper cell makes proteins that help the cells leave the nest properly. They hope that learning more about this helper protein will teach them ways to help human cells behave normally too. For example, maybe they can learn how to help cancer cells behave like regular cells again. That way, tumors might shrink or even go away completely! Or maybe they could help babies born with birth defects grow and work right. There are lots of things they still don't know about how cells talk to each other and how that affects everything around them. Hopefully, studying this little worm will tell them more about those things and help them figure out ways to fix problems in people. Yay science! Science is awesome! Let's keep doing it forever and ever amen! (Sorry, I got carried away there for a minute). Anyway, yay science!!! NOW let's get back to reading this cool article!!!!!!!!! (P.S. Sorry about all the exclamation points. I just got really excited about science for a sec). (Pssst. Don't tell anyone I said this, but I think exclamations marks are kind of fun!)

"Much of the work that has been done to understand how cells work has involved studying parts of a cell in isolation . This is particularly true of studies that have examined the arrangement of atoms in large molecules with elaborate structures like proteins or DNA . However , cells are densely packed with many different molecules and there is little proof that proteins keep the same structures inside cells that they have when they are studied alone . To really understand how cells work , new ways to understand how molecules behave inside cells are needed . While this cannot be achieved directly , technology has now reached the stage where we can , to some extent , study living cells by recreating them virtually . Simulated cells can copy the atomic details of all the molecules in a cell and can estimate how different molecules might behave together . Yu et al . have now developed a computer simulation of part of a cell from the bacterium , Mycoplasma genitalium , one of the simplest forms of life on Earth . This model suggested new possible interactions between molecules inside cells that cannot currently be studied in real cells . The model shows that some proteins have a much less rigid structure in cells than they do in isolation , whilst others are able to work together more closely to carry out certain tasks . Finally , the model predicted that small molecules such as food , water and drugs would move more slowly through cells as they become stuck or trapped by larger molecules . These results could be particularly important in helping to improve drug design . Currently the simulations are limited , and can only model parts of simple cells for less than a thousandth of a second . However , in future it should be possible to recreate larger and more complex cells , including human cells , for longer periods of time . These could be used to better study human diseases and help to design new treatments . The ultimate goal is to simulate a whole cell in full detail by combining all the available experimental data ."," Researchers have built a ""virtual"" version of part of a bacteria cell called the cytoplam. They did this by running a computer program called molecular dynamics simulation. First, researchers made a map of everything that exists in the cyctoplam. Next, they ran the computer program to make sure that the virtual cytoplasms behaved like real ones. Finally, they looked at how things worked together in the virtual cell. They found that having lots of things around can either keep them working properly or stop them from working properly. They think that this kind of modeling will help people build better versions of computers that work like biological cells. They say that this is just the start of building a computer model of the entire cell. This study shows that making maps of things and looking at how they work together can help people learn more about cells. This knowledge could help doctors find ways to treat diseases. It could also help people figure out how to make machines that work more like living things. That would be good because living things can usually deal with situations better than machines. People know a lot about how things work inside cells, but they don't really know how all of the pieces fit together. Making maps of how things are related to each other and figuring out how they interact could help solve that problem. Doctors could use that information to figure out why certain diseases happen and how to cure them. Scientists could use it to make robots that act more like biological things. Both kinds of uses could help people live healthier lives. This research helped get closer to solving those problems. The authors hope that other people will keep working on this project so that we can eventually figure out exactly how all the parts of cells fit together and how cells work. They want to do that because they think it will be fun to learn more and maybe help people. Other people probably want to keep doing this research too because they want to learn stuff and help people, just like the authors do."
"Influenza is caused by viruses that infect birds and mammals . These viruses enter cells when two lipid bilayers—one surrounding the virus , the other enclosing the cellular compartment into which the virus has been engulfed—merge to form a single unified membrane . This process , known as membrane fusion , allows the RNA of the virus to gain access to the host cell's molecular machinery , which it commandeers to produce multiple copies of itself and to direct the assembly of new virus particles . The process of membrane fusion generally includes an intermediate hemifused state in which only the adjacent monolayers from each bilayer have merged . In addition to its role in virology , membrane fusion is critical for many other biological processes , including exocytosis , protein trafficking and the fertilization of eggs by sperm . Efficient membrane fusion requires a catalyst , and a glycoprotein known as the influenza hemagglutinin performs this role for the influenza virus . The hemagglutinin is found on the surface of the virus , and a typical influenza virus particle can have a few hundred such molecules on its surface . When an influenza virus particle binds to the surface of a cell ( as a result of these hemagglutinin molecules interacting with cellular receptor molecules ) , the cell engulfs the virus into an internal compartment called an endosome . Acidification of the endosome , part of the cell's normal activity , triggers a sequence of conformational changes in the hemagglutinin molecules on the surface of the virus . One part of the hemagglutinin inserts itself into the endosomal membrane , and further conformational changes draw the endosomal and viral membranes together into an intermediate , hemifused state; the process then continues until fusion of the two membranes is complete . Previous work has suggested that an average of three hemagglutinin molecules are required to fuse the endosomal and viral membranes . Ivanovic et al . have now investigated the molecular details of this process and described the time course of conformational changes undergone by the hemagglutinin molecules from the moment the pH is lowered within the endosome until the time when hemifusion of the endosomal and viral membranes is complete . They find , among other things , that hemifusion proceeds rapidly only when three or four immediately adjacent hemagglutinin molecules have inserted into the endosomal membrane . Since membrane fusion is a very general cellular process , the findings of Ivanovic et al . are relevant to many areas of cell biology , in addition to having potential applications in virology ."," When influenza viruses invade our bodies, they need to get inside our cells to reproduce. They do this by merging with the outer layer of our cells. This happens after the virions attach themselves to special sugars on the outside of our body cells. Once attached, the virons change shape and merge with the cell wall. As part of this process, some parts of the virus coat dissolve and the virus becomes smaller. Then, the virus and cell walls join together and become one bigger structure. If this happened too fast, the cell might not have enough time to take in the materials it needs before joining together again. So, the authors studied how quickly each part of the process happens. By studying many virions, they found that most of them joined together pretty quickly. But, sometimes, they saw virions that took longer to join together. Looking closer at these slower virions showed that they had fewer copies of a protein called HA on their surfaces. Since the slower virion joined together later, the researchers think that having less HA on the surface slows down the joining process. This means that if you want to stop influenza from spreading, you should look for ways to slow down the virusions from joining together with your cells. One way to do this might be to find chemicals that keep HA from changing shapes and merging. Another way might be finding chemicals that prevent the virisons from sticking to the cells. Both of these ideas might give your body extra time to fight back before the virison joins together with the cells in your body. This might help your body fight off the flu. More research is needed to figure out exactly what chemicals to use to try to stop the flu from spreading. Research like this helps doctors learn more about why things happen and how to fix them. Understanding how virions join together with cells in our bodies gives us clues about how to stop them from doing this."
"The outer sheet of brain tissue , the neocortex , is composed of circuits formed from trillions of connections among billions of neurons , of which there are about one hundred different neuron types . The scale and complexity of cortical circuitry pose experimental challenges , leading to an incomplete understanding of how cortical cell types are connected and the computations that take place at the connections . About half of the cell types in the brain are excitatory , which means they can activate other cells . The cortex consists of several distinct layers of cells , within which excitatory cells cooperate to process the signals they receive from other cortical layers and brain areas . Using recordings of electrical activity arising from the connections between pairs of excitatory neurons , Seeman , Campagnola et al . measured the likelihood and strength of connectivity among related groups of excitatory cell types in slices of cortex taken from human and mouse brains . The initial results confirm previous findings that individual layers of human cortex can have more and stronger excitatory connections than the same layers of mouse cortex . In most layers of mouse cortex , repeatedly activating the excitatory cells leads to progressively weaker responses . However , in the upper layers of mouse cortex , the opposite effect is sometimes seen: more excitatory activity causes the connections to generate stronger responses . By feeding these data into a computer model , Seeman , Campagnola et al . described and compared the activity of the groups of related excitatory cell types . These results are the first of a new , large-scale project where findings can be integrated across experiments to gain a more detailed picture of cortical circuitry and computation . Neuroscientists will be able to use the results to build advanced computer models of cortical circuits . Such models will , for example , generate predictions for how the attributes of excitatory connectivity revealed by Seeman , Campagnola et al . influence how information is processed in the cortex . In so doing , the models will add to our understanding of how the human brain works both in health and in disease ."," Researchers studied how different groups of nerve cells communicate with each other inside the ""cortex"" of the human and mouse brain. They did this by carefully studying the way that nerve cells talk to each other using small bursts of electricity. They found that almost all of the nerve cells talked to others in some way, although very few of them communicated with more than just a couple of other nerve cells. They also looked at how these nerve cells send messages to each group and discovered that the message sent to one particular group of nerve cell was slightly different from what was sent to other groups. Overall, they found that even though the nerve cell groups were talking to each another, they still managed to understand each other quite well. This helps researchers better understand how the brain uses nerves to control things like movement and thought. It could also help doctors figure out why people get diseases like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s Disease. It might also teach computers how to work faster and smarter. Finally, it could help robots move more smoothly and naturally. That means that this research has helped us learn more about how to keep our own bodies healthy and use technology in new ways. For example, doctors might eventually be able to give patients who have problems moving parts of their body special glasses that read their thoughts and move their eyes instead of their arms and hands. Or maybe doctors could put tiny devices inside the brain that let them know when someone is feeling sad or angry so they can help them feel better. And maybe robots could become smart enough to play games with humans that help kids learn math or help adults learn how to drive cars. There are lots of exciting possibilities! Just imagine what you could do if your computer knew what you wanted to do before you told it? Maybe you could ask your computer to tell a funny story to your friend without telling him yourself! Or maybe you could think really hard about throwing a ball to your brother and he would run to catch it without you having to lift your arm at all!"
"For most animals , mating and fighting are critical for survival and reproduction . These behaviors are also closely related and share similar actions . How are such complex behaviors hard-wired into the brain ? A fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent system to investigate this problem , because flies mate and fight , and powerful genetic tools are available to probe the circuits of neurons that control these behaviors . A great deal has been learned recently about the neural circuits that control mating , but much less was known about how the circuits for aggression are organized . Hoopfer et al . systematically activated different sets of neurons in thousands of male flies to try to find the circuits that trigger aggression . While this identified some neurons that specifically promoted aggression , it also uncovered a cluster – called P1 neurons – that promoted both aggression and courtship . This was unexpected , because P1 neurons were previously thought to only control courtship behavior . The P1 neurons produced different behaviors at different stimulation thresholds , with the neurons requiring a stronger level of activation to promote courtship instead of aggression . Moreover , the P1 neurons triggered a lasting change in the internal state of the male that increased his tendency to engage in aggression or courtship . These results are reminiscent of observations made in mice , suggesting small groups of neurons that control mating and fighting may represent an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit ""motif"" for the control of social behavior . The next step is to figure out how P1 neurons trigger a persistent internal state of arousal or motivation , and to determine whether and how this circuitry participates in the ""decision"" to engage in mating or fighting ."," Why do people fight? Sometimes, fights can happen because someone wants something that belongs to somebody else. But sometimes, people just want to hurt others! In animals, too, they often fight over food or territory. And sometimes, they also seem to enjoy hurting others without any obvious reason. Researchers wanted to know what makes animals fight, so they looked at the brains of fruit flies. They discovered that some brain cells, called ""interneurons,"" play a big role in making flies fight. If these interneuron cells didn't work properly, the flies wouldn't fight as much. The researchers also learned that these inter neurons can make flies feel angry enough to fight, even if they don't really need to defend anything or get any food. So, it seems like these inter-neurons help decide whether or not to start a fight, based on things like hunger or how much space is available. This knowledge could help doctors treat people who have anger problems. Maybe doctors could learn ways to calm people's brains so that they don’t become violent. That would be great news for everyone!.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/1155/2021/6768667.10.7580/6689.20320891.1.2.128.117.21.3.13.22.23.34.14.25.15.26.16.27.DOI.org /10 /75 54 /e Life / 1 I 3 4 6.0 15 1.DOIs provided are valid for 5 years from date published.DOILife10·75·54Elife11·34·6.00310 ·75 ·54 ·eLife11 ·34 ·6."
"Most living organisms package their DNA into bundles called chromosomes . These chromosomes generally form pairs , with each chromosome in the pair containing the same number of genes . The genes also come in the same order , but the exact sequence of DNA bases within the genes can be different . When sex cells—such as egg , sperm or pollen cells—are made , each pair of chromosomes is separated so that the each sex cell contains only half the normal number of chromosomes . However , before they are separated , the pairs swap lengths of DNA via recombination events . These can involve exchanging large chunks of the chromosomes: this is called a ‘crossover’ . Alternatively , short stretches of one chromosome can be replaced by the corresponding region from the other in the pair . When these ‘non-crossovers’ cause a change in the DNA sequence they are known as gene conversions . Long-standing questions in the field of plant biology include: how common are gene conversions ? How much DNA is typically exchanged ? And where in the chromosomes do these events happen most ? Now , Wijnker et al . have addressed these questions by focusing on the accurate detection of recombination events , with a special emphasis on gene conversions , in the plant biologist’s favourite species: Arabidopsis . Searching for recombination events is a challenge because , when piecing together an entire genome from lots of shorter stretches of DNA—typically called ‘reads’ , it is easy to misplace some of the pieces . However , meticulous examination of these short DNA reads allowed Wijnker et al . to reliably identify gene conversions on a genome-wide scale . In Arabidopsis , gene conversion appears to be unexpectedly rare—with approximately one gene conversion detected per 140–240 non-crossovers . Recombination tends to occur in regions of the chromosomes where the DNA is only loosely packaged , is not heavily modified by the process of ‘DNA methylation’ , and also near the start of genes . Furthermore , two specific sequences of DNA bases were identified that marked ‘hot spots’ in the chromosomes , where recombination happens more frequently . Wijnker et al . suggest that the low number of gene conversions detected indicates that non-crossovers tend to exchange very short stretches of DNA . However , future research may point to additional mechanisms that explain the low incidence of gene conversion in Arabidopsis ."," Researchers have examined how the parts of a person's body change because of things like having children or getting sick. They did this by looking at the differences between the bodies of people who had the same parents. They found that some parts of the body, like the height of someone's nose, tend to stay the same, while others, like how tall someone is, change more easily. They also found that men and women have different ways of passing on these traits to their children. For example, how tall a man is tends to run in his family, but how tall women are does not always follow the pattern of their families. Finally, researchers found that sometimes the way a part of your body changes depends on what happens to you later in life. For instance, if someone gets really sick, they might lose weight, which would cause them to be shorter than before they got sick. The researchers hope that learning more about how our bodies change helps doctors figure out better ways to help patients. This could include helping people gain weight or get taller, or making sure that people don't get too sick. It could also involve figuring out ways to keep people healthy so they don' t get sick in the first place. The authors think that studying how our genes pass on traits to our kids could help us understand why some people are more likely to get sick than others. They think this could help doctors find better ways of treating illnesses. They believe that finding out more about the best ways to treat illnesses could help people live healthier lives. They want to learn more about this topic so they can continue trying to find answers. They hope that other people will join them in trying to solve these problems. If you have any questions about this article, please ask your teacher or a parent to talk to you about it. They should know how to answer your question or find out the answer for you."
"Mastering a new movement requires practice . Intensive and repetitive training is essential for musicians , athletes , or surgeons . It is also important for people undergoing rehabilitation to help them regain normal movements after an illness or injury . Although practice is said to make perfect , there comes the point when it also causes physical fatigue . Fatigue can impair how well a person performs a movement , but its effects on learning a task are less clear . Now , Branscheidt et al . show that being physically fatigued interferes with learning a new movement skill . In the experiments , volunteers were divided in two groups: the first group had to learn a new motor skill after their hand muscles were physically fatigued , the second group learned the same task without being worn out . The fatigued volunteers had a harder time learning a new motor task both on the day of the task and on the following days , even after they had recovered from the fatigue . The same experiment was repeated , but instead of learning a motor task , the volunteers were asked to learn a sequence of keystrokes . The volunteers in both groups learned this new thinking task easily . This suggests that learning new thinking tasks is not affected by physical fatigue . Branscheidt et al . also disrupted memory formation in part of the brain that controls movement after volunteers finished learning the motor task using a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . This eliminated the motor learning deficit in the fatigued group . This may suggest that memories formed after fatigue may impair later motor learning and that physical training or rehabilitation that pushes people to work past fatigue may be counterproductive . Further study of these processes may help to develop better training regimens and rehabilitation methods .","Physical exercise makes people tired. When people feel too tired to keep doing something, we call that ""muscle fatigue"". Some people try to train themselves to get better at something while they are feeling tired. But it isn't really clear if practicing like that helps you improve your skills later on. So, researchers did an experiment to test how being tired affects skill improvement. They asked people to squeeze a handle until they felt too tired, and then practiced squeezing the handle every day for about half an hour. After the first day, they tested how good people got at squeezing by measuring how hard they squeezed another handle. People who didn't squeeze the handle very much on the first practice day ended up getting better at squeezes harder on the second day. That means that being tired on the practice day actually hurt people's skill improvement! The researchers think that this happens because the muscles of people who practiced when they were already pretty tired might relax a bit, making them worse at the skill they practiced. If you want to get good at something, maybe don't push yourself too hard right away! Maybe start when you're fresh and build up to longer practice sessions gradually. That way, you won't tire out your muscles and ruin your chances of improving your skills. And if you ever feel too exhausted to go on, stop for a break and come back to it later. That will probably make you practice better in the long run. That's what the researchers found anyway! They also figured out that sometimes, feeling too tired can affect your skill improvement even if you aren't practicing when you feel tired. They did that by having people practice on one day, and not letting them practice on the next day. Even though they weren't allowed to practice on that day, people whose muscles were already kind of tired ended up being worse at practicing on the third day than people whose bodies weren' t tired yet. That shows that feeling too worn out can mess up your skill practice even if it doesn't happen when you practice. So yeah, if you want your practice to stick, take care of yourself and don' t push yourself past your limits. That sounds obvious, but lots of people forget it sometimes!"
"Healthy cells can typically repair damage to their DNA with high accuracy , keeping their genetic code intact . In contrast , cancer cells often lose this ability . Inaccurate repair leads to more frequent DNA mutations , which can make a tumor more aggressive . However , DNA repair-deficient tumors can be targeted with cancer therapies , such as PARP inhibitors , which kill cells that do not have working DNA repair mechanisms . PARP inhibitors show great promise clinically , but unfortunately some tumor cells can become resistant to these treatments over time . Recent work has shown that resistance to PARP inhibitors is often caused by further alternations to DNA repair machineries . Being able to visualize DNA repair in living cells is crucial to understanding this process and to find ways to improve cancer treatments . Previous studies have used repetitive DNA sequences called Lac operators ( LacO ) to visualize the dynamic behavior of DNA in live cells . Leland et al . have now adapted this system to watch individual DNA repair events in living yeast cells under the microscope . Their experiments reveal that when cells lose a single protein called Rev7 , an early phase of DNA repair becomes hyperactive . Leland et al . traced the cause of this hyperactivity to an enzyme in the RecQ helicase family . A RecQ helicase becoming hyperactive in cells lacking Rev7 could explain how some cancer cells become resistant to PARP inhibitor treatments . This information could help fine-tune future approaches to treating cancer . For example , using an inhibitor of RecQ helicase alongside PARP inhibitors may help block this type of resistance from developing in the first place . As well as potentially paving the way for better cancer treatments , this method of visualization could improve scientists’ understanding of the basic processes of DNA repair ."," Researchers have discovered that two protections called Rev7 and Crb2/53bp1 stop too much cutting of damaged DNA in cells. They do this by stopping a special type of cutting machine called RecQ and Dana2. Without these protections, there is too much copying going on in cells, which makes it harder to treat cancer patients who have broken DNA strands. To learn more about how these proteinations work, scientists studied them in yeast cells. By looking at individual yeast cell nucleuses, they saw that Rev7 or Crb1/52bp1 stopped too much RecQ/Dana2 cutting. So, when these protection break, too much of the wrong kind of cutting happens. Now researchers know more about why cancer cells sometimes resist being treated with medicines that target cells without these protection breaking. Knowing more about these proteactions might help doctors figure out ways to make these treatments better. That might happen by finding drugs that turn off Rev7, Crb/5b1p1, RecQ, or Dan2. Doctors might also try to give medicine before or after surgery to keep these proteacions working properly. Those things might help people survive longer. But those ideas still need to be tested. Right now, scientists think that these discoveries will help us understand more about what goes wrong in cells that resist cancer treatments. And maybe they will help find ways to fix those problems. That could make cancer treatments work better. But right now, those ideas are just guesses based on what happened in yeasts. So more tests need to happen before anyone knows for sure if those ideas will work in humans. If they do, though, they might help lots of people live longer. That means figuring out how to use these discoverings to improve cancer treatments takes a lot more work. But since scientists figured out how these things work in yeasty cells, they already did a big part of that work."
"Individuals of the same species have similar , but generally not identical , DNA sequences . This ‘genetic variation’ is due to random changes in the DNA—known as mutations—that occur among individuals . These mutations may be passed on to these individuals' offspring , who in turn pass them on to their descendants . Some of these mutations may have a positive or negative effect on the ability of the organisms to survive and reproduce , but others may have no effect at all . The process by which an embryo forms ( which is called embryogenesis ) follows a precisely controlled series of events . Within the same species , there is genetic variation in the DNA that programs embryogenesis , but it is not clear what effect this variation has on how the embryo develops . Here , Paaby et al . adapted a genetics technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study how genetic variation affects the development of a roundworm known as Caenorhabditis elegans . The experiments show that populations of worms harbor a lot of genetic variation that affects how they tolerate the loss of an important gene . One by one , Paaby et al . interrupted the activity of specific genes that embryos need in order to develop . How this affected the embryo , and whether or not it was able to survive , was due in large part to the naturally-occurring genetic variation in other genes in these worms . Paaby et al . 's findings serve as a reminder that the effect of a mutation depends on other DNA sequences in the organism . In humans , for example , a gene that causes a genetic disease may produce severe symptoms in one patient but mild symptoms in another . Future experiments will reveal the details of how genetic variation affects embryogenesis , which may also provide new insights into how complex processes in animals evolve over time ."," Embryos are the beginning stage of life for many kinds of animals. During embryonal stages, the body starts taking shape and developing features. Even though embryos go through the same basic motions, they might look slightly different depending on the type of animal. Sometimes, these slight changes can make a big impact later on in life. When looking closely at the embryones of roundworms called Caenorrhabditids, researchers noticed that they looked different from each other. They thought that maybe these differences were caused by tiny changes in the DNA of the worms. To find out if this was true, the researchers studied the embroyonic development of 28 different worm strains. They discovered that each strain had unique characteristics! This means that each worm strain developed differently, even though all of them started off as eggs at the same time. Because these differences didn't seem to matter much when the worm embros were young, the scientists call these tiny changes ""cryptic"" variations. Just like how you might have friends who look sort of alike, but really aren't, these cryptic variations are kind of like those differences between worm strands. But unlike your friends, these differences actually matter a lot! They ended up making the worm strand embrios more or less likely to die during development. Since these cryptics variations only seemed to matter when the embrios were getting ready to become adults, the study showed us that becoming an adult worm is kind of a tricky time for the worm. At this point, lots of things can go wrong, and even tiny changes can end up having huge impacts on the worm's chances of surviving. Just imagine trying to learn something new at school, but your teacher talks too quietly, writes too fast, or explains things in a way that doesn't make sense to you. It would be pretty hard to pay attention and learn anything, right? Now think about learning how to be a worm instead of how to read - that's basically what happens when a worm embrio gets ready to hatch! And just like in school, if something goes wrong, the worm might never learn how to properly be a grown-up worm. So, even tiny differences in how the embrio grows or what happens around it can make it harder for the embрио to survive and become an adult. The cool thing is that now scientists know about these crypticus variations, they can try to figure out how to prevent them from happening, or fix them"
"The chemical reactions that occur within a living organism are collectively referred to as its metabolism . Many metabolic reactions produce byproducts that will poison the cells if they are not dealt with: fermenting bacteria , for example , release harmful organic acids and alcohols . How the bacteria respond to these toxins has been most studied at the level of entire microbial populations , meaning the activities of individual cells are effectively “averaged” together . Yet , even two bacteria with the same genes and living in the same environment can behave in different ways . This raises the question: do bacterial populations specialize into distinct subpopulations that play distinct roles when dealing with metabolic products , or do all cells in the community act in unison ? Rosenthal et al . set out to answer this question for a community of Bacillus subtilis , a bacterium that is commonly studied in the laboratory and used for the industrial production of enzymes . The analysis focused on genes involved in fundamental metabolic processes , known as the TCA cycle , which the bacteria use to generate energy and build biomass . The experiments revealed that , even when all the cells are genetically identical , different Bacillus subtilis cells do indeed specialize into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates . Time-lapse movies of bacteria that made fluorescent markers of different colors whenever certain metabolic genes became active showed cells switching different colors on and off , indicating that they switch between metabolic subpopulations . Further biochemical studies and measures of gene activity revealed that the different subpopulations produce and release distinct metabolic products , including toxic byproducts . Notably , the release of these metabolites by one subpopulation appeared to activate other subpopulations within the community . This example of cells specializing into unique interacting metabolic subpopulations provides insight into several fundamental issues in microbiology and beyond . It is relevant to evolutionary biologists , since the fact that fractions of the population can switch in and out of a metabolic state , instead of evolving into several inflexible specialists , may provide an evolutionary advantage in fluctuating natural environments by reducing the risk of extinction . It also has implications for industrial fermentation processes and metabolic engineering , and may help biotechnologists design more efficient ways to harness bacterial metabolism to produce useful products ."," Microbes living in groups can sometimes split into separate groups that live differently. One way that this happens is if one part of the group makes things less acidic for everyone else. In order to figure out how this happens, scientists looked at a kind of bacteria called Bacilla subtilisa. They grew the bacteria in containers until they made lots of copies of themselves. Then, they took some of this mixture and let it grow again in a container. While doing this, they tested how much acid the bacteria made. They also checked how fast the bacteria grew. Finally, they looked at the bacteria under a microscope to see if any parts of the population were making more or fewer copies of itself. They did this by putting a yellow dye on the bacteria. If the bacteria make more copies of the dye, you know that they are growing faster. They saw that the bacteria divided into two kinds that lived differently. They figured out that one kind of the bacteria was making acid, and letting the other kind of Bacillas use it to live faster. This means that the first kind of bacilli were helping the others survive. This happened because the first ones died quickly. So, the first group helped the second group survive. The second group survived longer because they got rid of the acid. This is an example of how dividing into groups can help bacteria survive better in places where food runs out. Just like humans need to share tasks to get things done efficiently, bacteria can do the same thing. Sometimes, people think that bacteria just randomly decide to die off. But really, they choose to help each other survive. That’s why dividing up into groups is good for them. And that’s science! Now we know more about how bacteria live. Next time you see some bacteria, remember that they probably have jobs to do together! Maybe they’ll be building something, or eating something, and sharing it with each other! Or maybe they’re helping each other find a place to live. Who knows? Whatever they’d be doing together would be better than they’ve ever done alone. Because that’ s what friends are for!"
"Before a cell can divide to form two new cells , it must duplicate its DNA to ensure the newly formed cells have the same genetic information as the original . This genetic material is made up of two single strands of DNA that are paired to form a double-stranded helix . Certain groups of proteins separate these two DNA strands to form a two-pronged structure known as a ‘replication fork’ . This occurs at different points along the length of the DNA double helix . Groups of proteins then travel down the DNA strands , separating them as they go , and using them as templates for making copies of the DNA . DNA replication is finally completed when different replication forks meet and merge . This process does not always occur smoothly because some regions of DNA contain obstacles that impede the movement of the replication machinery . In most cases , the replication proteins briefly stall and then restart . However , occasionally the machinery can fall off the DNA; this event is known as a ‘replication fork collapse’ . Nguyen et al . have now used a method called time-lapse microscopy to visualise this process inside a species of yeast—called fission yeast—as it occurs in real time . Fission yeast's genetic material is known to contain a specific site that blocks the replication machinery . Nguyen et al . found that a protein called Rad52 arrives at this specific site within 10 minutes of a replication fork being blocked . This protein enables recovery of the replication fork within an hour via a process known as ‘DNA recombination’ . Nguyen et al . also unexpectedly found that the restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse . It is known from previous work that the mechanisms that repair broken DNA and rescue replication forks can also introduce errors into the DNA . This implies that if fork collapse occurs frequently , it can lead to the introduction of numerous errors that can be detrimental to cells . Thus , the rescue of fork collapse is like a double-edged sword; it is required for replication to proceed , but can lead to genetic changes inside cells . The failure to faithfully replicate genetic material drives the development of diseases such as cancer . Therefore , insights gained from Nguyen et al . 's findings may provide an improved understanding of how genetic alterations occur in both normal and cancerous cells ."," Replication problems can happen when there are obstacles along the double helix DNA strand. To solve this problem, the cell tries to fix the issue using a special kind of recomboination called recombinaison en replication (RER). Researchers looked at how RER worked in a particular area where there was a roadblock. They found that RER started almost immediately after the roadblock appeared and continued until another copy of the road was available. Sometimes, however, the roadblocks remained too long and led to dangerous situations. The researchers think that RERS is very useful for solving replication problems, but that it needs to be tightly controlled to avoid dangerous situations. The findings help explain why RER happens and how it affects the cell. This knowledge could help scientists understand how to treat diseases related to replication issues. The findings also help explain how cells deal with replication challenges and how they try to solve them. Understanding these things could help doctors develop new ways to treat patients who have replication disorders. Finally, knowing more about RER could help people learn how to take care of themselves and stay healthy. Overall, the findings are exciting and promising! They could lead us closer to finding cures for diseases linked to replications issues. That would be great news for everyone affected by these illnesses!. The authors want to thank the National Institutes of Health for funding their research. They also want to acknowledge the support of the European Union and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique for helping with the project. Lastly, they appreciate the assistance of colleagues from around the world who helped with the study. They hope their findings will benefit future research and potentially improve patient outcomes.. The author wants to thank his team for their hard work and dedication to the project, as well the National Science Foundation for supporting his research. He hopes that the findings will inspire others to explore the mysteries of life and contribute to science in meaningful ways."
"The genetic information inside our cells is stored in the form of chromosomes , which are carefully packaged strands of DNA . Most human cells contain a pair of each chromosome: one inherited from the mother and another from the father . Typically , when a human cell divides , it duplicates all of its chromosomes and then places one copy of each into the two new cells . However , a different process—known as ‘meiosis’—occurs when a human cell divides to make the cells involved in sexual reproduction ( i . e . , egg cells in females and sperm cells in males ) . First , the cell duplicates all of its chromosomes as before , but then it pairs the chromosomes originally from the mother with the equivalent chromosomes from the father . These paired chromosomes then swap sections of DNA . Next , the cell divides , and the resulting cells divide again; this produces four new cells that each contain a single , unique copy of every chromosome . In the process of swapping sections of DNA between chromosomes , the DNA molecule inside the chromosome is broken and different sections of DNA are then joined together . This can occur by one of two methods: ‘crossover events’ that produce a final chromosome made up of long sequences from each of the contributing chromosomes; and ‘non-crossover events’ , where only a small section of DNA is swapped between the chromosomes . Research has tended to focus on DNA breaks and crossover events . Now , Williams et al . have looked at the genetic sequences transmitted by both parents to 49 humans—revealing information about a total of 98 meioses—and scoured them for evidence of non-crossover events . In addition to finding 103 sites where these events occurred , Williams et al . discovered that non-crossover events are more frequent around sites where crossover events also have a higher frequency . This suggests that the mechanism that initiates non-crossover events is shared with crossovers , and that non-crossover events primarily occur during meiosis . Unexpectedly , in some areas non-crossover events were found close to each other in ‘clusters’ , which had not previously been seen in humans . Non-crossover events will only produce an observable change if the chromosomes involved have differences in the sequence of the DNA section that is swapped between them . The number of such variable genetic positions that non-crossover events affect in a generation is roughly the same number as the number of newly generated random mutations to the DNA sequence in a generation . Examining the DNA sequences transferred during non-crossover events also shows that two different types of DNA bases ( cytosine and guanine ) are more likely to be transmitted by a non-crossover event than are the other two bases ( adenine and thymine ) . This bias indicates that non-crossover events are an important factor in driving genome evolution . In the future , sequencing the entire genome—the total genetic material—of many different people could provide further insights into non-crossover events in humans ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about something called ""non-cross-over"" gene conversion (NCO), which happens when DNA copies from just one parent get passed down to offspring rather than mixing with DNA from both parents. They studied 96 pairs of chromosomes from human embryos and found evidence of NGO happening at 52 spots along those chromosome pairs. They also discovered that NCO tends to happen more often at places where DNA breaks usually happen. Finally, they saw that in four parts of the genome, nearby areas seemed to have happened NCO quite recently. Altogether, this study helps scientists learn more details about what happens inside cells during reproduction. Knowledge gained from this study could potentially help doctors detect problems caused by mistakes in reproduction, like cystic fibrosis. It could also help doctors find ways to treat patients whose illnesses are related to mistakes in DNA copying. Overall, this research gives scientists more tools to explore and understand things that go wrong in reproducing cells. That knowledge could eventually help doctors prevent or fix problems that result from those errors. Further research is needed to confirm the findings reported here. More studies could also reveal other benefits of learning more about NCO. For example, knowing more about how DNA gets copied could help doctors figure out why medicines don’t always work well for certain patients. Understanding how DNA is copied could also let doctors know ahead of time if a patient is likely to pass on a problematic mutation to his or her children. If doctors knew that, they could recommend steps to reduce the chance of passing on that mutation. Those are examples of some of the things that could become possible thanks to research like the kind reported here. The bottom line is that learning more details from studies like this one could give doctors more options to keep people healthy. That’s good news for everyone!"
"DNA in human and other animal cells is organised into structures called chromosomes . One of the most dangerous types of DNA damage is a double-strand break , where both strands of the DNA helix are broken in the same place . If this damage is not repaired it can be serious enough to kill the cell . If the DNA is repaired badly , part of one chromosome can become attached to another – a defect known as a chromosome translocation . Fortunately , cells are equipped with machineries that can recognise and fix these breaks . One of these processes is known as “non-homologous end joining” and it involves a set of proteins including two known as XRCC4 and XLF . These proteins work like a bandage , holding together the broken DNA until it is repaired . Both proteins have long tails , but the role of these structures was not clear . During DNA repair , the cell chemically modifies the tails of these proteins by a process called phosphorylation . However , previous studies have found that it is possible to prevent the modification of the tail of one of the proteins , or even remove the tail entirely , without affecting the repair process . Here , Normanno et al . investigated the effect of blocking the modification of the tails of both proteins at the same time . For the experiments , the tails were both altered in various places to either block or mimic the phosphorylation that normally occurs during DNA repair . Mimicking the phosphorylation of both tails affected the ability of XRCC4 and XLF to stay attached to the DNA , suggesting that the phosphorylation helps these proteins to detach from the DNA once the repair is complete . Furthermore , in human embryonic kidney cells the altered proteins were less able to repair DNA damage in response to a drug that causes double-strand breaks . These findings improve our understanding of how cells repair their DNA to maintain a complete set of genetic information . Defects in DNA repair are linked to conditions where the brain does not develop properly , whilst some cancer therapies deliberately inflict double-strand breaks to kill cancer cells . In the future , these findings may lead to improvements in radiotherapy and other treatments for human diseases ."," Scientists have learned about something called ""classical non- homologous ending joining"" (CNHEJ), which helps fix broken pieces of DNA when there isn't enough time to copy the DNA properly. They know that special proteins called XRRC4 and LIG 4 help put the broken parts back together. Another protein called XLIF also helps put the pieces back together, but only if XRFC4 and LI G4 aren't available. Now, scientists want to learn more about how XRFF4 and XIFL work together to fix the broken DNA. They did this by changing certain parts of the XLFIF proteins. When they changed part of the XIFL protein, the proteins didn't work as well anymore. When the changed the whole XRCIV protein, it worked better than normal. This means that the way the protections work together changes depending on whether or not the XLIF protein is working normally. This tells us that maybe the XRIFIF protein needs the XRFIC protein to work properly. If the XRLF protein doesn't need the XRAF protein to do its job, then the XLAF protein does its job just fine. This suggests that sometimes the XLLF protein can tell the XRMF protein what to do, but sometimes it can't. By learning more about these proteints, researchers hope to figure out ways to treat people who have problems with their DNA. For example, they might find ways to stop the wrong kind of fixing from happening, like when too much fixing happens. Or they might figure out how to get the DNA fixed faster. Both of these things would be good for treating people who don't have enough time for their DNA to fix itself properly. The authors think that the best way to do this is to use the knowledge they got from studying how the XLMF and XRFIF work together."
"Cancer develops when cells in the body mutate in ways that allow them to rapidly grow and divide . To protect cells from becoming cancerous , various molecules act like guardians to prevent cells from dividing when their DNA is damaged , or if they are short of energy . Other guardian molecules monitor the DNA copying process to ensure that the newly-made DNA is as identical as possible to the original DNA template . A protein called p21 belongs to the first group of guardian molecules: DNA damage triggers the production of p21 , which prevents the cell from copying its DNA . This role relies on a section of the protein called the CDK binding domain . Cells that have already started to copy their genetic material also have low levels of p21 . Mansilla et al . used human cells to investigate whether p21 is also involved in the process of copying DNA . The experiments show that the low levels of p21 act to increase the speed at which the DNA is copied . This activity helps to ensure that all of the cell’s DNA is copied within the time available , including sections of DNA that are harder to copy because they are more fragile and prone to damage . This newly identified role does not involve the CDK binding domain , but instead requires a different section of the p21 protein known as the PCNA interacting region . Mansilla et al . propose that p21 plays a dual role in protecting us from developing cancer . The PCNA interacting region is also found in other proteins that are involved in copying DNA . Therefore , a future challenge is to find out how these proteins interact with each other to ensure that cells accurately copy their DNA in a timely fashion ."," Researchers have learned that there is a protein named ""p21"" that helps keep our cells safe from getting sick. They wanted to know what happens when you take away the ""p"" part of ""p-21"". So, they did just that and saw that things went wrong. It seemed that having enough ""p's"" helped keep the ""polymerases"", which copy your DNA, working right. Without enough ""P's,"" parts of your DNA got messed up. That meant that the ""polymerses"" couldn't copy everything correctly. Sometimes, those places would get stuck and need help from something else to finish copying. Those places are called ""common fragile spots."" So, having enough p2""s"" helps keep your DNA running smoothly and makes sure your cells stay healthy. That way, you won't get sick. But, if you don't have enough ""Ps,"" those places will break and your cells will get sick! Yuck! So, always making sure you have enough p's is good and keeping them around is really important! And now we know why! Cool! 1) What problem does the researchers want to solve? The researchers want us to know how to keep our bodies safe from bad things happening to our cells. 2) How do scientists think they will fix the problem? By figuring out how to make sure we have enough of a kind of protein called ""p."" 3) Why is it important to learn this thing? Because if we don'tknow how to protect our cells, they can get hurt and that can make us feel sick. 4) What did the scientists find out? That the ""P"" part helps keep the machines that copy your cells going smoothly. 5) Is it good or bad that they figured this out? Good! Because now weknow how to help our cells work better and stay healthy!"
"Estimates suggest that more than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease . This condition , which is incurable , is characterised by the death of brain cells leading to tremors and loss of motor control . So far scientists have been able to link mutations in nearly 20 different genes to Parkinson’s disease . This includes the gene that codes for an enzyme called PINK1 . Mutations that affect PINK1 are often seen in people with early-onset Parkinson’s disease and cases that are inherited through families . Changes to PINK1 affects the ability of cells to keep producing energy . Without enough energy to power biochemical processes , affected cells will eventually die . Understanding why PINK1 has this effect and how to prevent it could be helpful in treating Parkinson’s disease . One way to understand the role of PINK1 is to study the three-dimensional structure of the protein to examine how it interacts with other molecules . The PINK1 protein from the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is easier to produce than human PINK1; this makes it easier to study its structure in the laboratory . Using flour beetle PINK1 and a technique called X-ray crystallography , Kumar , Tamjar , Waddell et al . made a detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of the PINK1 protein . This revealed new details of the structure including a region at one end called the “C-terminal extension” , which is involved in PINK1’s enzyme activities . The structure also highlighted the purposes of two loop regions , one that controls PINK1 activity and one that affects its interactions with other proteins . Further examination of some of these features showed that they are also part of human PINK1 proteins . Using this new protein structure , Kumar et al . went on to examine 20 mutations that are found in patients with Parkinson’s disease and have been able to show the effect that these changes have on PINK1 at a molecular level . It may now be possible to begin designing drugs to prevent or reverse these changes , which could lead to new treatments for Parkinson’s disease ."," Mutations in a protein called PINK 1 are linked to a rare kind of Parkinsons Disease. Scientists wanted to learn about the structure and function of PINk 1 to better understand why these mutations lead to Parkinsong's Disease. They studied the structure in a worm version of Pink 1 and learned that it works differently than expected. Specifically, they found that PINK has extra pieces inside it that stick out and make it look like a bowl. They think that these pieces help PINK work properly. They also found another piece that helps PINK do its job. Finally, they looked at the mutations and figured out how those mutations stop PINK from working correctly. Overall, they think that the mutated versions of Pinks 1 don't work because the middle bits get in the way of the bowl part doing its job and the extra piece falls off. They hope that learning about PINK will help scientists figure out ways to treat Parkinsongs Disease better. They did this by looking at the structure closely and figuring out how it worked. They used a computer program to put the pieces together and then checked their answer by seeing if it fit together well. Then, they tried putting the pieces in different places and saw if that made sense too. After trying lots of different ways to put things together, they picked the ones that seemed to work the best. Next, they took pictures of their models and looked really closely at those pictures to try to figure out how everything fits together. Finally they used a special kind of glue to ""stick"" the pieces of Pink 1 together. Once they had all the pieces stuck together nicely, they used something called x-ray crystals to take pictures of the pink 1 again. Those pictures helped them figure out if anything was still broken or wrong. They fixed anything that wasn't quite right and repeated the process until they were happy with how well pink  worked. At the end, they compared the pictures of pink  with the pictures they took earlier and wrote down everything they learned. They then used a fancy computer program that let them put all the little pieces of pink together again, just like they did before. They looked at those new pictures and wrote more stuff down about how pink  works. They finally figured out that the middle pieces keep the outside pieces from moving around and falling apart. That lets the outside piece move freely and do its jobs. Finally the outside part gets moved around by something else and"
"Dengue fever is an infectious tropical disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes carrying dengue virus . Almost half of the world’s population lives in dengue-plagued regions and it is estimated that between 50 and 100 million people are infected annually . However , there is no effective vaccine and researchers have only a limited understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease . While most infected individuals experience fever , headache , muscle and joint pain , and a skin rash , a small percentage go on to develop a life-threatening condition known as dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) . This is marked by internal bleeding , and by the leakage of water and salts from blood vessels ( vascular leakage ) . At present , it is difficult to tell which patients will develop this complication , making it hard to tailor treatment appropriately . Here , St John et al . reveal that the vascular leakage that occurs in DHF is triggered by mast cells , which line blood vessels and regulate their permeability through the release of molecules such as histamines and leukotrienes . They also found that mice deficient in mast cells did not show dengue-induced vascular leakage , and that wild-type animals treated with drugs that block the actions of proteins produced by these cells , showed less vascular leakage than controls . Moreover , levels of an enzyme called chymase , another mast cell product , are higher in human patients with DHF than in those with dengue fever . Since chymase release occurs early in infection , tests for the presence of this enzyme could be used to predict which patients are likely to develop DHF . The work of St John et al . suggests new lines of inquiry into the mechanisms that lead some individuals infected with dengue fever to develop DHF , and indicates that drugs that target mast cells could offer an effective treatment ."," When you get sick with dengUE virus (DENV), your body might start to bleed. Researchers think that this bleeding happens because the dengEE virus makes special cells in your body release too much fluid into your bloodstream. They want to know more about why these cells release too little fluid. So, they looked at something called ""mast cells"" that releases chemicals when you get a bug bite. They found that these cells can release things that make your blood vessels leak. If they give mice a drug that stops these cells from releasing things, the mice live longer and their blood doesn't leak as much. They also found that people who got really sick from DENV had these cells already released things before they even started feeling sick! Another thing they learned is that another kind of cell, called ""chymase,"" can also make your body's blood vessels start to leak. They think that these two kinds of cells might be bad for you when you have the dEngUE virus. They hope that finding ways to stop these cells might help people feel better when they get sick from the dEnGue virus. Right now, they are testing a drug on people to see if it helps them feel better. It would be cool if they found a way to treat people who already have the disease, or maybe even prevent it! That would be awesome! But, right now, we still need to learn more about how these cells work. Hopefully, researchers will figure out a way soon to help people who get sick. Until then, just remember to wear long sleeves, pants, hats, and bug spray whenever you go outside, especially if you travel somewhere where there are bugs that carry the dENgue virus! And, if you ever get sick, go to the doctor right away so they can try to help you feel better fast! Good luck!"
"Alexander disease is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative condition . It is caused by mutations in a gene that is crucial for the structure of astrocytes , a type of brain cell whose role is to support neurons . The gene codes for a protein called GFAP , which is made almost exclusively in astrocytes . In Alexander disease , mutated versions of the gene make GFAP collect in disordered clumps or aggregates , which interfere with the astrocytes’ normal activities . All Alexander disease patients develop GFAP aggregates , but the type of mutation they have in the gene for GFAP does not predict how their illness will progress . The age of onset of disease , for example , can vary between less than one year old to more than 70 years old . Battaglia et al . sought to understand how GFAP aggregates form in the cells of Alexander disease patients . One way that GFAP can be altered in the cell is by a process called phosphorylation . Enzymes called kinases add phosphate groups to GFAP , which can regulate the protein’s activity , stability and interactions with other proteins . Battaglia et al . found high levels of phosphorylation at one specific site in the GFAP protein in people who had very early onset of Alexander disease . This phosphorylation was not related to any particular mutation in the gene for GFAP . An added phosphate group at this location in the protein made GFAP more likely to be broken into two pieces by an enzyme called caspase-6 . One of the breakdown products is already known to play a role in aggregation . Young patients with Alexander disease had high levels of GFAP breakdown products and caspase-6 . The phosphorylated protein and this enzyme were found to accumulate in astrocyte aggregates . The findings provide a basis for investigating new strategies to treat Alexander disease that target phosphorylation – as removing or preventing the addition of phosphate groups can be done with drugs . But before exploring how to do this , it will be necessary to find out which enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating GFAP at this particular position . These studies may also give a broader understanding of other GFAP-like proteins ( called intermediate filament proteins ) , which are involved in over 70 human diseases ."," There is a condition called Alexander Disease (AD) that happens when something goes wrong with a kind of protein called Glial Fibrillay Acidic Protein (GFAP). Normally, GFAP helps keep astroglia cells healthy. Astroglial cells are star shaped and help keep neurons alive. When things go wrong with GFAP, astroclia don’t work properly anymore. Some scientists think that problems with GFAPI happen because of mistakes in the gene that makes GFAP. Other scientists think it happens because of another reason. They looked very closely at the GFAP in the brains of people with AD and found that sometimes, the GFPA had been changed in a special way called phosphate added to serine 13. Sometimes, this happened even without a mistake in the GFAPP gene. But, most of the time, the change only happened in people with really bad AD. Also, sometimes, a protein called Caspase 6 cut GFAP into smaller pieces. Usually, Caspases 6 doesn’t cut GFPA, but only when the GFPAR13 was changed. So, maybe the GFPS13 change is what makes Caspese 6 break GFAP down into little pieces. Maybe looking at whether GFPARS13 is changed can tell doctors whether someone with AD will get better or worse. That way, doctors can figure out what medicine to give them. Or maybe they can find a way to stop the GFSPAR13 from being changed. Then, the Caspasse 6 won’t break the GFAPI down into tiny pieces. That means the astrocilia will still work, even though there is a problem with the GFApi. It’s just one idea about why some people with the AD gene change get really sick and others don’tk. More research needs to be done to see if this idea is right."
"Diseases spread by mosquito bites – like malaria , dengue and Zika – kill over half a million people each year . Many of these diseases have no cure , and those that do often face the problem of drug resistance . As such , the most effective way to control these diseases is to reduce the number of mosquitoes in the affected area . Yet , this kind of control strategy relies on knowing which species of mosquito that spread diseases to humans and where they are found . Most current methods to monitor mosquitoes are laborious , and need expensive equipment and highly trained people . This makes them less suitable for resource-poor areas , which typically have the highest levels of mosquito-borne diseases . However , scientists have known for many decades that one can identify species of mosquito by the pitch of sound they make when they fly . The challenge was to find instruments that could record these sounds clearly enough to measure the pitch , but that were still cheap and sturdy enough to use in mosquito-infested environments . Mukundarajan et al . now report that the microphones in ordinary mobile phones are sensitive enough to accurately record the whining buzz of a mosquito , even in the presence of background noise . First , techniques were developed that allow anybody to record mosquitoes on virtually any mobile phone model – including smartphones and basic flip-phones . Next , the sounds of 20 species of mosquito that spread diseases to humans were recorded – more than in any previous study . When other recordings made using various phones were compared to this collection of sounds , the correct species was automatically identified for two thirds of the recordings . This meant that , together with volunteers who were trained for 15 minutes , Mukundarajan et al . could use mobile phone recordings to map mosquito species inside a National Park in California and a village in Madagascar more efficiently than with any conventional method . There are over five billion mobile phones in use today . Even a small percentage of mobile users recording mosquito sounds could thus provide a tremendous amount of data . As more and more people contribute recordings , Mukundarajan et al . hope to be able to make real-time global maps of mosquito distributions . These could then be used to design better strategies to control mosquitoes and combat mosquito-borne diseases ."," Mosquitos cause many dangerous diseases like malaria, yellow fever, zika virus etc. They live in tropical and subtropical countries. Scientists have tried to kill them with insecticides but this has not worked properly. So scientists thought of finding ways to avoid mosquitos altogether. One way is to know where the mosquits are and when. For this purpose, scientists have used special microphones attached to mobile phones to listen to the sound produced by mosquitis wings flapping. This helps us to know the type of mosquisito based on the sound it produces. Mobile phone technology is cheap and easy to use anywhere in the world. People can learn easily to use it. With this technology, scientists can get information about mosquitos from everywhere in the word. This will help them to take steps to reduce the population of mosqutios before they start spreading diseases again. But there are some problems too. Sometimes mosquotos produce almost the same kind of sound so it becomes hard to tell which one is which. Also, if there are other noises around, it becomes harder to hear the mosquto sound. Still, scientists think that this problem can be solved and mobile phone technology can be a great tool to fight against mosquiti related diseases. That’s why they recommend using this technology along with other methods to stop mosquoto born diseases. If we can solve the current limitations, mobile phone based technology can prove to be a very good weapon against mosqto borne diseases. This technology can also be helpful in studying the life cycle of mosqtios. This can give us clues about when and where to use insecticidal sprays to kill maximum numbers of mosquetos. Overall, this technology can help us to save millions of lives lost due to mosquitol borne deadly diseases. Scientist are working to improve this technique so that we can benefit from it soon."
"The immune system protects against disease by recognizing invading pathogens , such as bacteria and viruses , and launching various responses to eliminate them . In vertebrates , such as mice and humans , this response often involves both an ‘innate’ and an ‘adaptive’ component . The innate immune response is fast but it is not targeted at the specific pathogen that needs to be eliminated . The adaptive immune response is slower , but it is also stronger and tailored to combat the specific pathogen that is attacking the host . In general , both the innate and adaptive immune responses work together to combat the infection . The innate immune system is activated when host cells are damaged or stressed , or when ‘foreign’ molecules that are tell-tale signs of microbes and pathogens are detected . It enlists white blood cells that engulf and digest infected host cells or pathogens , and then display the digested fragments via proteins called major histocompatibility complexes . The adaptive immune response relies on other white blood cells called B cells ( which make antibodies ) and T cells ( which carry out a variety of roles ) . Each T cell will respond to a very specific fragment of protein displayed by a major histocompatibility complex . Although a bacteria or virus can generate thousands of protein fragments , only a select few will stimulate an immune response . This phenomenon is known as immunodominance . As T cells mature in the thymus—a specialized organ located in the chest—they undergo both positive and negative selection . To survive positive selection , the T cells must be able to recognize fragments from the host’s own proteins . Negative selection removes T cells that interact too strongly with these ‘self-peptides’ because such interactions will cause the T cells to destroy the host’s tissues and cause auto-immune diseases . Positive selection is thought to have an important role in immunodominance because it shapes the population of T cells released from the thymus , but it has been difficult to test this hypothesis . Now Lo et al . have explored this question by engineering transgenic mice in which gp250—a self peptide that positively selects T cells that respond to a foreign protein called MCC—was the only self peptide to be presented during positive selection . Subsequent experiments showed that the mature T cells released by the thymus increased the fraction of T cells that were capable of responding to the dominant fraction of possible MCC fragments . By establishing a clear connection between positive selection and immunodominance , the work of Lo et al . could assist the development of more effective vaccines ."," When your body fights an infection, certain kinds of cells called T cells attack and destroy the germs causing the illness. Before you get sick, your body makes T cells that can recognize and kill those germs. But sometimes, your T cells don’t work properly because they aren’t programmed correctly. That means your body won’t be ready to fight off germs when you really need it. Scientists wanted to know why some T cells work well and others don’tkill germs properly. So, they looked at how T cells are made inside your body. There are lots of ways that T cells can be made, and each way makes T cellsa little bit differently. Some ways make T cellsthat work well, and others ways make them that don’twork well. By looking closely at how one kind of T cellwas made, scientists learned that the way the T cell was made helped decide what kind of germs it would be good at fighting. This finding helps explain why some people get sick easily while others don't. Understanding how T cellsmake germs easier or harder to kill could help doctors find ways to treat people who have problems with their immune systems. This discovery could also help researchers learn how to make vaccines that work better. If scientists can teach T cells to recognize and attack germs that cause disease, then vaccines could stop germs before they make people sick. That would be great news! Now, scientists want to look closer at how other kinds of T cellsare made to see if they follow the same rules. Maybe they will find even more ways to help people’s bodies stay healthy. That sounds pretty cool! Who knows? Maybe someday they will even figure out ways to make superhero T cells! Then everyone will be safe from getting sick. Yay! Science is fun! And it’s really cool to learn stuff like this!"
"The brain has a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in circumstances . But what happens to the brain when it loses a key source of input , for example , following the amputation of a limb ? A region of the brain known as primary somatosensory cortex processes sensory inputs from all over the body . The more sensitive an area of the body is , the more fine-grained its representation is in the cortex . For example , the hand is represented with a highly detailed map , with each finger represented seperately . The brain is thought to require ongoing sensory signals from the body to maintain these detailed representations in the cortex . Indeed , textbooks typically state that the brain will ‘overwrite’ its representation of a body part if input from that area no longer arrives . According to this view , people who have lost a hand should show little or no activity in the area of primary somatosensory cortex that used to represent it . However , many people who have had a limb amputated continue to experience vivid sensations of the missing limb long after its loss . When asked to move their so-called ‘phantom’ limb , these individuals report being able to feel the movement . Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . now show , using advanced imaging techniques , that the brains of individuals with phantom hands continue to represent the missing hand several decades after its loss . Indeed , asking the subjects to move individual fingers of their phantom hand activates fine-grained representations of those fingers , similar to those seen in two-handed controls . By showing that the brain ‘remembers’ an amputated hand , Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . demonstrate that ongoing sensory input is not required to maintain representations of the body in somatosensory cortex . This , in turn , offers new hope for developing prosthetic limbs that are under direct brain control . If the brain continues to represent individual fingers many years after their loss , it should be possible to exploit those pathways to achieve intuitive fine-grained control of artificial fingers ."," People who lose a part of their body still feel like the missing body part. Scientists wanted to know why people still feel the presence of something that isn't there anymore. They did experiments on people who had lost arms and legs, and found out that the parts of the body that no longer exist still have a place in the mind. Even if someone loses a leg, they might still feel their toes moving! But how does this happen? Scientists think that the brain keeps the memory of the whole body, even if some parts aren't really there anymore! So, even without the toe, the brain knows what a foot feels like. Just like how you remember your favourite toy growing up, even though you don't play with it anymore. It's still special to you! If doctors can teach robots to move just like real hands, maybe they can learn to feel like real feet too! That would be amazing, because then the robot wouldn't need to touch anything to know what it's feeling. It would already know what to expect before touching anything! That means the robot would be smarter than any regular machine ever made! And that would be awesome! Because then machines would understand feelings better than people sometimes do! That's pretty cool! I wonder if robots will eventually take over the world...but only if they promise not to hurt anyone! I hope they let us humans join in on the fun too! Maybe we could all hang out together and share stories about our adventures! That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I knew what everyone else was thinking right now…maybe I could help them feel better! Or maybe they could help me! Sharing feelings is kind of like sharing toys when we were little. Sometimes we played nicely, and sometimes we fought over them. But usually we shared and had lots of fun together! I guess that's what friends are for!"
"Genes are turned into their protein products via two steps . The first , transcription , produces an intermediate RNA molecule or ‘transcript’; the second step , translation , turns the transcript into a protein . Most genes in mammals contain stretches of DNA called exons , which code for protein , interspersed with sequences called introns that do not . Therefore , a transcript must be ‘spliced’ before translation—the introns are removed and the exons joined . In some genes , certain exons can be optionally included or excluded from a transcript to produce different versions of the same protein that can often have very different functions . This is known as alternative splicing , and is essential for normal development . A large number of regulatory proteins control this process , many of which are only made in specific types of cells or tissues . Esrp1 and Esrp2 are two proteins that regulate alternative splicing in epithelial cells . These specialized cells form sheets that line most organs in the body and are found in the epidermis , the outermost layer of the skin . Although Esrp1 and Esrp2 have previously been studied in the laboratory using cultured cell lines , their roles have not been investigated in living animals . Bebee , Park et al . have now examined mice that are unable to produce one or both of these proteins . Mice that only lacked Esrp1 developed a cleft lip and palate . In mice that lacked both proteins , many organs failed to develop correctly and in some cases did not form at all . In the epidermis , the loss of Esrp1 and Esrp2 disrupted the splicing of the transcripts from genes that give epithelial cells many of their specialized characteristics , such as the ability to form sheets of cells with well formed junctions between them . This meant that epidermis that lacked Esrp1 and Esrp2 could not form a proper barrier layer , which is a crucial role of epithelia in skin as well as in other organs . In future , the mutant mice will be valuable for exploring how alternative splicing affects the development of epithelial cells and their properties ."," Researchers discovered that two special kinds of proteins, called Esrp's, help decide how the body makes different versions of proteinthese proteins come from the same gene, but have slightly different jobs. They found that removing both copies of Esrpa and one copy of Esrb from mouse cells causes problems with the skin. They then looked at how the skin cells make different versionsof a protein called FgFr2. Normally, this protein makes two different versions, but when the Esrp proteins aren't working properly, the skin doesn't know which version to make! This can cause problems with how the cells grow and divide. The researchers also looked at the skin of mouselacking both copies Esrpb and onecopy of Esra. They saw that the skin didn't look right, and that the cells weren't making enough of one kind of FGF protein. Finally, they looked at a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, and found that the cancer cells had changed how they made the FGF proteins. This change helped them grow faster and take over nearby healthy cells. Overall, the study shows that the Esrs proteins are really important for helping skin cells choose which versions of the FgF proteins they should make. If they don't make the right choice, it can lead to problems with skin health. Understanding how these proteins work together could help doctors find better treatments for people who have skin diseases. For example, they could try to fix the problem by giving patients medicine that would help the skin make the ""right"" version of FGFR2 again. Or maybe they could give medicines that would stop the cancer from growing. More research needs to be done to figure out exactly how these special proteins help the cells, and why they sometimes make the wrong version ofthe FGFprotein. But overall, this study gives us a lot more to think about when trying to understand how skin works, and how to keep it healthy!"
"Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and affects more than 40% of adults in the United States . People with obesity have a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease . Changes in diet and exercise can be difficult to follow and result in minimal weight loss that is rarely sustained overtime . In fact , in people with obesity , weight loss can lower the metabolism leading to increased weight gain . New drugs may help some individuals achieve 5 to 10% weight loss but have side effects that prevent long-term use . Previous studies in mice show that a hormone called Lipocalin-2 ( LCN2 ) suppresses appetite . It also reduces body weight and improves sugar metabolism in the animals . But whether this hormone has the same effects in humans or other primates is unclear . If it does , LCN2 might be a potential obesity treatment . Now , Petropoulou et al . show that LCN2 suppressed appetite in humans and monkeys . In human studies , LCN2 levels increased after a meal in individuals with normal weight or overweight , but not in individuals with obesity . Higher levels of LCN2 in a person’s blood were also associated with a feeling of reduced hunger . Using brain scans , Petropoulou et al . showed that LCN2 crossed the blood-brain barrier in monkeys and bound to the hypothalamus , the brain center regulating appetite and energy balance . LCN2 also bound to human and monkey hypothalamus tissue in laboratory experiments . When injected into monkeys , the hormone suppressed food intake and lowered body weight without toxic effects in short-term studies . The experiments lay the initial groundwork for testing whether LCN2 might be a useful treatment for obesity . More studies in animals will help scientists understand how LCN2 works , which patients might benefit , how it would be given to patients and for how long . Clinical trials would also be needed to verify whether it is an effective and safe treatment for obesity ."," Obese people tend to eat too much food and feel hungry even after eating a big meal. Researchers wanted to know why this happens. They looked at a special kind of protein called lipocalin 2 (LCN 2) that can tell the brain when to stop eating. They found that LNC 2 goes up in the blood right after a person eats something. When researchers gave LCN 2 to animals, the animals ate less food and felt full faster. Then, the researchers showed that LCM 2 went up in people who weren’t obese, but didn’t go up in obese people. Finally, the scientists showed that the LCN protein could enter the brain and tell the “full” part of the brain to say “stop eating.” So, maybe one day doctors could give people extra LCN so they wouldn’t get hungry between meals! That would mean fewer trips to the grocery store and less food wasted. Also, maybe people who don’t have enough food to eat could take LCN to help themselves feel full. But more research needs to be done before we know for sure that giving people LCN is safe and helpful. For example, someone could have an allergic reaction to LCN. Or maybe taking LCN could cause someone to gain weight instead of losing weight. If scientists learn more about LCN, then maybe someday we’ll know how to help people who feel hungry all the time. And maybe we’d know how people who already have lots of fat around their bellies could lose weight and start feeling healthier. That would be great news for everyone! 😃 𝓪𝒾𝑂𝐶𝔼 𞕊𝗦𝖽𝚿𝛌𝙁𝜀𝘁🧠 𢆂 𬰡 𤍥 𣄸 𫮱 𩳋 𨯰 𭴹 𵅎 𱯻 𺇝 𜏟 𓈈 𑅷 𒄴 𔼂 ➔ 𠆕 𐍂 ‎ ‎‬‬‬ ‎​‬‬ ​‬‬​‬ ‬‬‎"
"Mice are primarily nocturnal animals that rely on their whiskers to navigate dark underground burrows and winding corridors . When a whisker touches an object , cells called neurons at the base of the whiskers produce electrical signals that are relayed to other neurons in an area of the brain called the barrel cortex . However , it is not clear how information is encoded in these electrical signals , in part , because it is technically challenging to collect data about neuron activity and behavior while the mice move around . To overcome these difficulties , Sofroniew , Vlasov et al . used a touch-based ( or 'tactile' ) virtual reality system to study how mice navigate along corridors . The system simulated the contact the whiskers would have with the walls of a winding corridor . This was achieved by moving the walls with motors while holding the mouse still enough to be able to measure the activity of neurons in the barrel cortex and observe the behavior of the animal . The experiments show that the electrical signals in the barrel cortex encode information about motion as well as the distance between the mouse and the wall . For example , some neurons in the barrel cortex were only activated when a mouse was a particular distance from the walls . The experiments suggest that the barrel cortex processes signals received from several whiskers to build an overall picture of the locations and shapes of objects . Sofroniew , Vlasov et al . also used a technique called optogenetics to deliberately activate particular neurons in a manner that mimics their activity patterns during interactions with walls . In the absence of walls , the optogenetic stimuli guided the behavior of the mice so that they tracked along the paths of 'illusory' corridors . Together , these findings reveal the neural code in the barrel cortex that allows mice to navigate by touch ."," Animals explore their environment to gather information about things around them. Sometimes, this involves touching objects with their bodies. Scientists wanted to know how the part of the mouse brain called barrel cortices react to touch while the animal moves. They discovered that neurons here are active when the mouse touches something, and that they become more active when they move closer to the thing. Some neurons became less active when getting close to the object. Together, these neuronal reactions helped the mouse keep track of the distance to the closest wall. It seems like the barrel court might play a role helping the mouse navigate. The scientists also looked at how the neuron activity changed when the animal moved slowly compared to quickly. They found that the neuronal activity was stronger when the animals moved faster. This shows that the barrel courts are especially good at working when the mouses are moving fast. Overall, the findings indicate that the mouse barrel cortical neurons encode information about distance to nearby surfaces. This encoding happens regardless of whether the surface is touched or whether the animal is moving quickly or slowly. The authors think that this encoding probably comes from multiple sources including the actual touch itself, the animal's movements, and perhaps even vision. They propose that the combination of these factors creates a detailed picture of the surrounding environment. Understanding how the barrel courts contribute to navigation could help researchers develop new ways to treat diseases that disrupt movement. Additionally, knowing how the mouse uses its barrel corticals could give insights into how humans use their own barrel corticles, which are involved in tasks like tool use and language comprehension. The findings could also inspire engineers to design robots that mimic aspects of animal movement. By combining touch sensors with artificial barrel cortics, robots could better sense and interact with their environment. This could allow them to do things like avoid obstacles and navigate through cluttered spaces. Overall the findings shed light on how the human brain works and offer ideas for creating machines that behave more like living creatures."
"The immune system protects the body from dangerous microbes and removes damaged cells . However , in some cases , the immune system can malfunction and attack healthy tissues , which can lead to type-1 diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and other autoimmune diseases . Many of the current treatments for these disorders suppress the immune system , which can make the individuals more susceptible to infections . It may be possible to treat autoimmune diseases using small pieces of protein—called peptides—that are based on proteins found on the cells that the immune system attacks by mistake . This strategy would target the specific immune cells that are malfunctioning , but allow the rest of the immune system to continue to work as normal . Peptide-based therapies for autoimmune diseases are currently being tested in clinical trials , and although the results look promising , it is not known precisely how they work . McPherson et al . used mice that develop a disease similar to multiple sclerosis because some of their immune cells , known as effector T cells , attack a protein found in the mouse brain called MBP . The mice were treated with a peptide based on part of MBP , which prevented them from developing the autoimmune disease . The success of the peptide therapy depended on the T cells producing large amounts of a protein called PD-1 . This protein stops the T-cells from activating immune responses when they detect the MBP protein . The gene that makes PD-1 can have a methyl-tag—a chemical modification to DNA—which alters how much PD-1 is made in the T cells . When the gene has this methyl-tag , it can only be switched on for a short time to make a small amount of PD-1 , which helps to control the immune responses activated by the T cell . However , when the methyl-tag was removed as a result of the peptide therapy the gene could be switched on for much longer , so that much more PD-1 was produced . This work helps us to understand how peptide therapy works and should improve the chances of using this therapy to successfully treat patients with autoimmune diseases ."," Researchers wanted to know why some people who receive treatment for a type of brain inflammation called multiple sclerosis ( MS ), called relapsing remitting multiple sclsosis (RRMS), still experience symptoms of the illness. They thought that maybe the person's own immune cells were attacking the wrong part of their brain. So, they took samples from the brains of people with RRMS and studied them. They found that a particular type of immune cell, called a T cell, was attacking a specific part of the brain called the white matter. They also found that the T cells were making a type called interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). They wanted to learn more about why this was happening, so they did more studies. They learned that a chemical called programmed cell death 1 (PD- 1) was involved. Normally, PD- ½ helps keep the T cell from attacking the brain. But sometimes, something goes wrong and the T-cell doesn't listen to the PD1 signal anymore. That allows the T to attack the brain, causing problems like memory loss, trouble walking, and muscle weakness. The researchers think that they might be able to fix this problem by finding a way to turn the PD ½ back on again. Then the T won't attack the white parts of the person’s brain anymore. They hope that learning more about this will help them figure out a way of treating people with MS so that they don't have to worry about having problems with their memories or muscles anymore. People with MS should talk to their doctors about this research and ask if it applies to them. Doctors should explain what they learned and what it might mean for patients. Patients should try to remember the names of the chemicals and proteins mentioned in the article so they can look them up online to learn even more about them."
"Before humans invented agriculture and the first farmers appeared in southwestern Asia , other ancient foragers ( also known as hunter-gatherers ) in southeastern Europe had already developed a taste for consuming wild plants . There is evidence to suggest that these foragers were intensely gathering wild cereal grains before the arrival of agriculture . However , until now , the only place outside southwestern Asia this has been shown to have occurred is in Greece , and is dated around 20 , 000 years ago . In the past , researchers proposed that forager societies in the Balkans also consumed wild cereals before transitioning to agriculture . But this has been difficult to prove because plant foods are less likely to preserve than animal bones and teeth , making them harder to detect in prehistoric contexts . To overcome this , Cristiani et al . studied teeth from 60 individuals found in archaeological sites between Serbia and Romania , which are attributed to the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods . Food particles extracted from crusty deposits on the teeth ( called the dental calculus ) were found to contain structures typically found in plants . In addition , Cristiani et al . discovered similar plant food residues on ground stone tools which also contained traces of wear associated with the processing of wild cereals . These findings suggest that foragers in the central Balkans were already consuming certain species of wild cereal grains 11 , 500 years ago , before agriculture arrived in Europe . It is possible that sharing knowledge about plant resources may have helped introduce domesticated plant species in to this region as early as 6500 BC . This work challenges the deep-rooted idea that the diet of hunter-gatherers during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods primarily consisted of animal proteins . In addition , it highlights the active role the eating habits of foragers might have played in introducing certain domesticated plant species that have become primary staples of our diet today ."," Archaeologists studied teeth from people who lived in what is now Romania during the Stone Age. They looked at the teeth to figure out what foods the people ate. They also looked at stones that the people used for grinding food to see what kinds of seeds and nuts the people were eating. The people seemed to eat mostly fruits and nuts instead of grasses. So, even though farming started in nearby places around the same time, the people in Romania didn't start eating grains until much later. It's thought that the reason why these people didn' t eat grain is because they already knew how good nuts and fruit were! Maybe this is why the first Romanian farmers focused on growing grains that tasted like the nuts and fruits they already liked. This could help explain how farming eventually became popular in that area. This is really interesting because it helps us learn about how people decided what to eat thousands of years ago! And maybe, just maybe, it can give us ideas about what we should eat today! Or tomorrow! Or even this very moment! Eat up, my friend!

"Cancer is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells . Normal cells can become cancerous if they acquire genetic mutations that allow them to divide more rapidly and ignore certain growth-halting signals from other cells in the body . Therefore , researchers are studying and cataloguing all the genetic changes found in cancers with the hope that this information will provide a clearer understanding of how they start to develop . Some types of mutations are well studied and easily identified by current technologies . However , some tumors contain few of these well-known mutations , which suggests that other types of mutations may be involved . Ni and Kuperwasser set out to discover some of these other types of genetic mutations in cancer cells and to find out how they contribute to cells becoming cancerous . Initial experiments showed that human breast cancer cells contain variants of proteins not found in healthy cells . In particular , there was a protein called MAGI3 that was abnormally short , but not due to any well-known mutations . This , in turn , led to the discovery of a type of mutation – called premature polyadenylation – affecting the gene that encodes MAGI3 . Next , Ni and Kuperwasser used biochemical techniques to show that the shortened MAGI3 protein inappropriately switches on another protein called YAP , which causes cells to grow more quickly . Approximately 7 . 5% of breast cancer patients have the shortened version of MAGI3 due to premature polyadenylation , which indicates that this might be a more widespread mutation than previously thought . Future studies will have to determine exactly how premature polyadenylation occurs in cancer cells , and whether it affects other genes and is found in other types of cancer ."," Scientists have found a way that cells can make too much of a type of protein called MAGE3. This extra protein makes cells become cancer cells faster than usual. When this happens, the cells lose something else that helps keep them from becoming cancer cells. So even though the cells are growing fast, they don’t turn into cancer cells because they are missing this thing. But if you give the cells the thing they are lacking, the cancer will happen anyway! This shows us that sometimes having too much or too little of the wrong kind of protein can cause problems. It also teaches us about ways to figure out what kinds of things might go wrong in cells. That is really helpful for figuring out ways to fix things! And maybe even ways to stop cancer from happening in the first place! That would be amazing! Let’s hope scientists learn more and more about how to do that soon. Maybe they can even find a way to stop it before it starts! Wouldn’t that be awesome? I sure think so! Do you? Yes, please!

"Our ability to recognize objects , and to respond instinctively to them , is something that is not fully understood . For example , seeing your favorite dessert could trigger an irresistible urge to eat it . Yet precisely how the image of the dessert could trigger an inner desire to indulge is a question that has so far eluded scientists . This compelling question also applies to the animal kingdom . Predators often demonstrate a typical hunting behavior upon seeing their prey from a distance . But just how the image of the prey triggers this hunting behavior is not known . Semmelhack et al . have now investigated this question by looking at the hunting behavior of zebrafish larvae . The larvae's prey is a tiny microbe that resembles a small moving dot . When the larvae encounter something that looks like their prey , they demonstrate a hardwired hunting response towards it . The hunting behavior consists of a series of swimming maneuvers to help the larvae successfully capture their prey . Semmelhack et al . used prey decoys to lure the zebrafish larvae , and video recordings to monitor the larvae's response . During the recordings , the larvae were embedded in a bed of jelly with only their tails free to move . The larvae's tail movements were recorded , and because the larvae are completely transparent , their brain activity could be visually monitored at the same time using calcium dyes . Using this approach , Semmelhack et al . identified a specific area of the brain that is responsible for triggering the larvae's hunting behavior . It turns out that this brain region forms a circuit that directly connects the retina at the back of the eye to nerve centers that control hunting maneuvers . So when the larva sees its prey , this circuit could directly trigger the larva's hunting behavior . When the circuit was specifically destroyed with a laser , this instinctive hunting response was impaired . These findings suggest that predators have a distinct brain circuit that hardwires their hunting response to images of their prey . Future studies would involve understanding precisely how this circuit coordinates the larvae's complex hunting behavior .","Animals like fish and birds need to catch their prey quickly and efficiently. They often spot their target with their eyes and move towards it fast. But how do they know if something is worth catching? Researchers wanted to learn how young zebra fish decide if something should be eaten. Young zebras hunt for things like tiny paramecia and rotifers. They swim around looking for food and sometimes stop swimming and start eating. Sometimes they even eat things that look like food, like a little ball rolling past them. So, how does the zebrah know if it sees food? It turns out that zebrashave special cells in their eyes that tell them if something looks good enough to eat! Scientists watched young zeeberfish and recorded how they moved when they saw different kinds of things. Then they looked at the way the fish behaved and figured out ways to measure how much the fish liked what they had just seen. They did this by watching the fish swim and measuring how big the movements were that happened right after the fish saw something. They also measured how much fish ate when they were fed different foods. Finally, they learned about a place in the fish brain that got very excited when the fish were feeding. They knew this was probably the place that told the fish if something was worth eating. They looked at this place in young zeesbrafish brains and found out that it gets really excited when they are seeing things that they might want to eat. They think that this part of their brain tells them if somethings good enoughto eat! And that is why they slow down and start munching! This discovery will help us learn more about how animals choose what to eat. That will teach us more about what it means to choose what you eat and how to make healthy choices too!. This work will help people better understand how animals behave and how they make decisions."
"Division of labor is essential for cooperation , because groups can achieve more when individuals specialize in different tasks . This happens across the natural world , from different cells in organisms performing specific roles , to the individuals in an ant colony carrying out diverse duties . In both of these systems , individuals work together to ensure the survival of the collective unit – the body or the colony – instead of competing against each other . One of the main ways division of labor is evident within these two systems is regarding reproduction . Both in the body and in an ant colony , only one or a few individual units can reproduce , while the rest provide support . In the case of ant colonies , only queens and males reproduce , while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food . This intense cooperation requires close communication between individual units – in the case of some species of ants , by sharing fluids mouth-to-mouth . These fluids contain food but also many molecules produced by the ants themselves , including proteins . Given that both individuals and the colony as a whole change as they age – with workers acquiring new roles , and new queens and males only reared once the colony is mature – it is likely that the proteins transmitted in the fluid also change . To better understand whether the lifecycles of individuals and the age of the colony affect the fluids shared by carpenter ants Camponotus floridanus , Hakala et al . examined the ant-produced proteins in these fluids . This revealed differences in the proteins shared by young and mature colonies , and young nurse ants and older forager ants . In young colonies , the fluids contained proteins involved in fast sugar processing; while in mature colonies , the fluids contained more proteins to store nutrients , which help insect larvae grow into larger individuals , like queens . Young worker ants , who spend their time nursing the brood , produced more anti-aging proteins . This may be because these ants are in close contact with the queen , who lives much longer than the rest of the ants in the colony . Taken together , these observations suggest that ants divide the labor of metabolism , as well as work and reproduction . Dividing the labor of metabolism among individuals is one more similarity between ants and the cells of a multicellular organism , like a fly or a human . Division of labor allows the sharing of burden , with some individuals lightening the load of others . Understanding how ants achieve this by sharing fluids could shed new light on this complex exchange at other scales or in other organisms . By matching proteins to life stages , researchers have a starting point to examine individual molecules in more detail ."," Ants exchange a sugary substance called trophhallactic fluid (TF) to communicate important information about their environment and their own bodies. Previous research has suggested that TF plays a role in maintaining cooperation within ant colonies, but there hasn't been enough evidence to confirm this idea. In this study, researchers analyzed the composition of TF in colonies at different stages in their lifecycle. They found that younger colonies share TF containing mostly sugars, while older colonies also share TF with proteins involved in immune responses and detoxification. Additionally, they discovered that certain proteins are present in TF from individual ants that are actively exploring their surroundings, while others are only found in TF shared within the colony. Overall, the results suggest that TF might play a role as a ""superorganism signal"" that coordinates activities within the entire colony. However, more experiments need to be conducted to fully test this hypothesis. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of how communication within animal societies affects their overall function and success. Understanding these kinds of interactions is important for managing ecosystems and designing artificial societies that mimic nature. The methods developed in this study could also be used in other contexts, such as analyzing blood plasma or saliva. This would help us gain a deeper understanding of diseases and disorders that affect people and animals alike. Finally, the authors propose that TF could serve as a non-invasive indicator of disease status in managed bee colonies. This could lead to early detection of problems and improved management practices. Overall this study shows that TF is a promising source of information about colony health and activity. Future research should focus on identifying the functions of specific TF proteins and how they interact with each other. This will give us a better understanding of the biological processes behind TF signaling and its role in colony functioning. Furthermore, investigations into the relationship between TF and environmental factors, such temperature and nutrition, could shed light on how external pressures impact colony health. Ultimately, this research could lead us towards new ways to manage and protect threatened species, such pollinating insects."
"It has been clear since the early days of structural biology in the late 1950s that proteins and other biomolecules are continually changing shape , and that these changes have an important influence on both the structure and function of the molecules . X-ray diffraction can provide detailed information about the structure of a protein , but only limited information about how its structure fluctuates over time . Detailed information about the dynamic behaviour of proteins is essential for a proper understanding of a variety of processes , including catalysis , ligand binding and protein–protein interactions , and could also prove useful in drug design . Currently most of the X-ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank are ‘snap-shots’ with limited or no information about protein dynamics . However , X-ray diffraction patterns are affected by the dynamics of the protein , and also by distortions of the crystal lattice , so three-dimensional ( 3D ) models of proteins ought to take these phenomena into account . Molecular-dynamics ( MD ) computer simulations transform 3D structures into 4D ‘molecular movies’ by predicting the movement of individual atoms . Combining MD simulations with crystallographic data has the potential to produce more realistic ensemble models of proteins in which the atomic fluctuations are represented by multiple structures within the ensemble . Moreover , in addition to improved structural information , this process—which is called ensemble refinement—can provide dynamical information about the protein . Earlier attempts to do this ran into problems because the number of model parameters needed was greater than the number of observed data points . Burnley et al . now overcome this problem by modelling local molecular vibrations with MD simulations and , at the same time , using a course-grain model to describe global disorder of longer length scales . Ensemble refinement of high-resolution X-ray diffraction datasets for 20 different proteins from the Protein Data Bank produced a better fit to the data than single structures for all 20 proteins . Ensemble refinement also revealed that 3 of the 20 proteins had a ‘molten core’ , rather than the well-ordered residues core found in most proteins: this is likely to be important in various biological functions including ligand binding , filament formation and enzymatic function . Burnley et al . also showed that a HIV enzyme underwent an order–disorder transition that is likely to influence how this enzyme works , and that similar transitions might influence the interactions between the small-molecule drug Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) and the enzymes it targets . Ensemble refinement could be applied to the majority of crystallography data currently being collected , or collected in the past , so further insights into the properties and interactions of a variety of proteins and other biomolecules can be expected ."," Researchers have learned how to make computer models of protein crystals that include information about how atoms in the crystal move. They made these models by combining information from X ray pictures taken of the crystal with calculations done by computers. The researchers tested their models by comparing them to what they already knew about the crystal. They think that these models might help them understand how proteins work and change shape. They hope that these kinds of models will help doctors figure out ways to treat illnesses. The authors want other scientists to be able to use their methods to make models of other proteins. They shared their methods and some of their models with other scientists. They expect that other scientists will test their ideas and maybe come up with better ones.

"A common birth defect known as holoprosencephaly affects how the brain and face of a fetus develop in the womb . In many cases , the condition is so severe that the fetus dies before , or shortly after , birth . Mutations in certain genes that control how the fetus develops are associated with holoprosencephaly . For example , mutations in components of the Hedgehog and Nodal signaling pathways , which transmit information that help cells to become specialized , increase the risk that a fetus will develop holoprosencephaly . Environmental factors , such as exposure to alcohol in the womb , are also thought to contribute to this condition . A gene known as Cdon is a component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway . In 2012 , a team of researchers reported that mice with a mutation in the Cdon gene exposed to alcohol in the womb develop symptoms similar to holoprosencephaly in humans . Here , Hong et al . – including some of the researchers involved in the previous work – set out to understand how Cdon and alcohol work together to cause holoprosencephaly in the mutant mice . First , the team exposed pregnant mice to alcohol at different times during gestation to find out when their young were sensitive to developing holoprosencephaly . This showed that the young mice were most sensitive in early pregnancy when the Nodal pathway was active in their growing bodies . Further experiments found that alcohol and mutations in Cdon change Nodal signaling in cells . Together , these findings demonstrate that exposure to alcohol in the womb works together with the mutant form of Cdon via the Nodal signaling pathway , rather than the Hedgehog pathway , to cause holoprosencephaly in mice . The causes of many common birth defects are complex and difficult to distinguish at the level of individual cases . The work of Hong et al . illuminates how multiple risk factors during pregnancy , which may not create any problems on their own , may work together to produce birth defects in the fetus . The findings also offer new ways to understand how exposure to alcohol in the womb affects the fetus . Ultimately , understanding how birth defects form could lead to new strategies to prevent them in the future ."," Holoprosencaphaly (HPE) is a condition where parts of the brain and face do not fully develop properly. Researchers wanted to learn more about how HPE happens. One reason why researchers think HPE might happen is because of something called fetal alchohol syndrome (FAS). FAS is what happens if a pregnant person drinks too much alcohol. Sometimes babies who have FAS will also have HPE. Researcher already knew that a protein called cdon might play a role in HPE happening. So, they looked closer at cdon and found out that it works with another protein called nodal. They also know that nodal does not always work well in people who drink too much during pregnancy. By studying this more closely, researchers learned even more about why HPE sometimes happens. This helps doctors figure out how to best care for people who have HEP. It also helps scientists learn more ways to help babies born with HPE and their families. That is very important! Because of this research, maybe someday we will know even more ways how to help these babies and their mommies. That would make everyone happy!

"Fine-tuning the amount of water present in the body at any given time is a tight balancing act . The hormone vasopressin helps to ensure that organisms do not get too dehydrated by allowing water in the urine to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream . A group of vasopressin neurons in the brain trigger the release of the hormone if water levels get too low ( as reflected by an increase in osmolality , the level of substances dissolved in a unit of blood ) . However , these cells also receive additional information that allows them to predict and respond to upcoming changes in water levels . For example , drinking water while dehydrated ‘switches off’ the neurons , even before osmolality is restored in the blood to normal levels . Eating , on the other hand , rapidly activates vasopressin neurons before the food is digested and blood osmolality increases as a result . How vasopressin neurons receive this ‘anticipatory’ information remains unclear . Kim et al . explored this question in mice by inhibiting different sets of brain cells one by one , and then examining whether the neurons could still exhibit anticipatory responses . This revealed a remarkable division of labor in the neural circuits that regulate vasopressin neurons: two completely different sets of neurons from distinct areas of the brain are dedicated to relaying anticipatory information about either water or food intake . These findings help to understand how healthy levels of water can be maintained in the body . Overall , they give a glimpse into the neural mechanisms that underlie anticipatory forms of regulation , which can also take place when hunger or thirst neurons ‘foresee’ that food or water will be consumed ."," Water balance is very important because if there is too little or too much water in your body, you might get sick. There are several ways that your body regulates water balance. First, your body responds to changes in water levels by releasing extra water through peeing or vomiting, or by taking in more water through drinking or eating food. Second, a special kind of hormone called vasopresin (also called AVP) helps keep water levels steady by telling your kidneys how much water to hold onto when you drink water. Scientists know that AVPs are produced by certain nerve cells deep in the brain. They also know that those nerve cells are controlled by signals coming from other parts of the brain that tell them to turn off or turn on the production of AVPs depending on how much you have already drunk. Now, scientists think that they have figured out where those controlling signals come from. It turns out that there are actually two different sets of nerve cells that send messages to the AVP-producing nerve cells. One set of nerves sends signals to the part of the nervous system that controls making AVPs when you eat something. Another set of nerve sends signals when you are thirsty and want to drink something. When you start feeling thirst, your stomach starts sending signals to tell your brain that you need to drink soon. Then, the second set of brain nerves tells the first set of brains to stop producing AVPs so that your kidney knows to let go of water and pass it through your urine. That way, you can drink enough water to quench your thirst. So, even though both sets of nerves tell the AVPs to do the same thing, they do it at different times. If you haven’t eaten anything in a while and feel really thirst y, your brain gets a message from your stomach saying that you should drink soon, so your brain doesn’t make AVPs anymore until you have had a chance to drink some water. But if you just ate a big meal, your tummy feels full, so it sends a different message to your brain telling it not to make AVP yet. That keeps your kidnyes from letting go of too much watyer."
"The fossil traces of Stone Age humans and other animals in the Grotta della Bàsura cave system in Italy have been studied since the 1950s . Italian archaeologist Virginia Chiappella published the first studies; she documented bones from an extinct cave bear , human and animal footprints , charcoal from torches , finger marks , and lumps of clay stuck on the walls . Since then , many more archeologists and anthropologists have studied the cave and its fossils . Yet there are still lessons to be learned from this prehistoric site . Now , Romano et al . have combined a number of different approaches and used some of the latest technology and cutting-edge software to analyze 180 footprints and other tracks found in the cave . These trace fossils date to about 14 , 000 years ago , and the analysis revealed that they were left by a group of Stone Age humans who descended at least 400 meters into the cave . The group consisted of two adults , an adolescent and two children of about three and six years old . At one point they had to crawl through a low tunnel – something that has not previously been documented in the fossil record . The group were all barefoot , had no clothing on their arms and legs and used wooden torches to light the way . Together , these findings suggest that young children were active group members during the late Stone Age , even when carrying out apparently dangerous activities . Romano et al . now hope that their multidisciplinary approach may help other scientists looking to understand how humans behaved elsewhere in the world at various points in history ."," Scientists studied footprints left behind by ancient humans in a cave in Italy. They learned that five people walked through the cave together. Two of them were grownups, one was a child, and two others were babies who might have been only a few months old. All of them had no shoes on when they went inside the cave. Some parts of the footprints were worn down because the people who made them stepped on them again and again. By looking closely at the footprint shapes, scientists figured out some interesting facts about the people. For instance, they knew that the toes of the feet were straight and pointed forward. Also, the heels of the adult’s feet touched the ground while the baby’s did not. Because of this, scientists think that the babies were carried on the adults’ backs. Finally, scientists measured the footsteps to learn more about the heights and weights of the people and how old they were. Overall, this shows that babies were able to walk along with the adults and join them in exploring places like dark caves! That means that babies played an important part in the lives of early humans. It also tells us that babies probably grew up faster back then than they do today. Maybe because they moved around more and got stronger sooner! Scientists hope that studying these footprints helps us to know what life was like for early humans thousands of years ago. And maybe it will teach us something about how to raise healthy kids today too!. The authors conclude that the footfalls of the trackmaker #5 were smaller than those of the other trackmakers, possibly due to the shorter tibias of trackmaker#5. They suggest that trackmaker 5 was a female, although this cannot be confirmed without additional supporting evidence. The authors state that the pedal digit II of trackmakers #1, #2, and #3 were abducted, whereas digits II and V of track maker #4 were adduced. They argue that this indicates that trackmakers#1,#2,and #3 walked with their hallux facing forward, whereas trackmaker IV walked with his fifth toe pointing forward.

"Brains learn from experience . They take events from the past , link them together , and use them to predict the future . This is true for fruit flies , Drosophila melanogaster , as well as for humans . One of the main questions in the field of neuroscience is , how does this kind of associative learning happen ? Fruit fly larvae can learn to associate a certain smell with a sugar reward . When a group of larvae learn to associate a smell with sugar , most but not all of them will approach that smell in the future . This shows associative learning in action , but it raises a big question . Did the larvae that failed to approach the smell fail to learn , or did they just happen to make a mistake finding the smell ? Given another chance , would exactly the same larvae approach the smell as the first time ? In other words , did all the larvae learn a little , or did some larvae learn completely and others learn nothing ? To find out , Lesar et al . built a computer-controlled maze to test whether individual fruit fly larvae liked or avoided a smell . Whenever a larva reached the middle of the Y-shaped maze , it could choose to go down one of two remaining corridors . One corridor contained air and the other carbon dioxide , a gas they would naturally avoid . Lesar et al . taught each larva to like carbon dioxide by activating reward neurons in its brain while filling the maze with carbon dioxide gas . Studying each larva as it navigated the maze revealed that they learn in a single jump , a 'lightbulb moment' . When Lesar et al . activated the reward neurons , the larva either ‘got it’ and stopped avoiding carbon dioxide altogether , or it did not . In the second case , it behaved as if it had received no training at all . Classic and modern experiments on people suggest that humans might also learn in jumps , but research on our own brains is challenging . Fruit flies are an excellent model organism to study memory formation because they are easy to breed , and it is easy to manipulate their genetic code . Work in flies has already revealed many of the genes and cells responsible for learning and memory . But , to find the specific brain changes that explain learning , researchers need to know whether the animals they are examining have actually learned something . This new maze could help researchers to identify those individuals , making it easier to find out exactly how associative learning works ."," Learning means remembering something based on previous experiences. Animals learn very fast even though they don't need to remember forever. Scientists want to understand how animals store information for longer periods of time. They use flies to investigate this question. Flies can learn to associate one thing with another. For instance, they can learn that a smell means food is nearby. But it is hard to teach flies to remember the association between a smell and food for a long time. So scientists came up with ways to test if flies learned something. Now, scientists have created a better method to check if flies remembered associations. Using this method, they discovered that flies could remember what they learned for several weeks. Also, they figured out that the amount of times flies experienced the association determines how well they would remember later. If flies got trained a lot, they would keep remembering even after a break. On the contrary, if they got trained less, they wouldn't remember as much afterwards. Lastly, scientists tested if flies needed proteins to remember what happened to them. They saw that flies didn't forget even if they couldn't make new proteins. Overall, scientists found ways to train flies to associate a smell with food. Then, they checked if the flies remembered what they learnt. They also figured out how many times the flies needed to get trained to remember for a longer period of time and how breaks helped them remember for even longer. At last, they determined if the ability of flies to memorise depended on making new proteings. All in all, scientists discovered that they could train flies and then check if they remembered what happened. They realised that flies needed lots of repetitions to remember. Afterwards, they understood that taking pauses helps flies to retain knowledge for longer. And finally, they concluded that flies can remember stuff even if their bodies aren't allowed to make new molecules."
"Bats produce loud calls and listen to the returning echoes to find their way around . This process , known as echolocation , is sometimes described as 'seeing with sound' . The way bats perceive the world through echolocation , however , is fundamentally different from how we experience it through vision . Echolocation provides much less information about the world than vision does , but despite this , bats are agile navigators and hunters . It is not clear how bats navigate so well without much information . In particular , researchers would like to know how echolocating bats recognize the places that they regularly visit while foraging and navigating . When we visually recognize places , we identify and localize the various objects making up the scene . But echolocation is unlikely to provide enough information to allow bats to identify and localize the objects in a particular place . To investigate how bats recognize places , Vanderelst et al . built an artificial bat: a device that contained ultrasonic microphones to act like the bat’s ears and an ultrasonic speaker to act like the bat’s mouth . The artificial bat device was then used to collect echoes from different locations in real bat habitats . Processing the echoes using machine-learning techniques showed that the echoes that returned from each location were different enough for a computer to recognize the location . By using a simplified version of the echoes , Vanderelst et al . also showed that the locations could be recognized even if there was not enough information to identify specific objects or vegetation at the site . This suggests that bats do not simply use echolocation to recreate the three-dimensional layout of a location , as some researchers have proposed . While much remains to be learned about how bats use echolocation for navigation , future work that teases out bat navigation strategies might help us to build robots that can navigate using similar tactics ."," Scientists used special devices to send out sounds and measure the answers to figure out if bats could tell where they were by listening to the sound waves that came back. They tested this idea in three very different places and found that bats seemed to remember what their calls sounded like better in places that looked alike. So, bats may use the way a sound wave comes back to them to know where they are! This means that batts might be able learn about places just by flying there and hearing how their calls sound after they get there. That could let them find good places to eat even in the dark! This idea needs to be checked in other kinds of places before scientists know for sure if batts use this cool trick. If they do, then we will know even more about how batts can fly around in the darkness!

"A protective membrane surrounds all cells , and controls what goes in and out of the cell . Many proteins that are made inside the cell need to be exported in order to do their job . In most organisms , a specialised transport motor that sits inside the membrane , known as 'Sec' , carries out this export process . Sec recognises proteins that need to be exported and pushes them across the membrane and out of the cell . The energy required to do this comes from the cell's universal power source , a molecule called ATP . Previous studies have shown what Sec looks like , but not how it pushes proteins from one side of the membrane to the other . Currently , the most popular theory for how Sec works is that it grabs hold of part of the protein and pushes it through a gate in the membrane . It then lets go and goes back to grab and push the next bit of the protein . Allen , Corey , Oatley et al . have now used a combination of experimental and computational methods to look at how the different parts of Sec move around as it uses ATP . The reasoning behind using these methods was that it's easier to understand how a motor works by watching it in action rather than just looking at a still picture . Using these methods , Allen , Corey , Oatley et al . show that the biggest movement in Sec as it uses ATP is in the membrane gate itself , which opens and closes . This suggests that Sec acts like a turnstile: proteins can freely move one way across the membrane , but are prevented from moving back in again . This mechanism has not been described before and may apply to other transport systems . Further investigations will be needed to understand exactly how Sec recognises cargo and starts the transport process , and to explore the specific features of a protein that activate the turnstile . It also remains to be discovered how this transport process differs in other , non-bacterial cells . This could potentially help us develop new drugs that specifically block the bacterial Sec system without affecting human cells ."," Proteins are made in the cell’s interior and need to be sent to different places in the cells. To reach their destinations, proteins cross through pores in the membrane that surround the cell. Scientists call these pores “transporters”. They use energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to pull proteins across the membranes. It is not yet completely clear exactly how the transporter pulls the proteins through. In this study, scientists looked closely at one of these transporters, called SecY, and tried to figure out how it works. First, they watched how SecY moves when it is making a protein transporter. Then, they added chemicals to try to stop the transporter from working properly. Finally, they measured how well the transports worked. From these experiments, the researchers learned that the transport needs both ATP to give energy and chemicals that tell the transpot if the protein is ready to go through. Together, these results helped scientists learn more about how proteins are moved around inside cells. This helps us understand how cells work and how diseases happen. Understanding how proteases are moved could help doctors find ways to treat people who have diseases caused by problems with protein transport. This could include things like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. It could also help us learn how to make better vaccines. It might even teach us how to design new medicines that target protein transport in bacteria to fight bacterial infections. This study shows that we still have lots to learn about how protein transport happens inside cells, and more research is needed to find out even more!

"In most adult animals , male and female brains are slightly different . For example , in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , certain neurons exist in one sex but not the other . Nerve cells that are shared in both sexes may also activate different genes , or form different connections in males and females . Most of these differences – which ultimately give rise to sex-specific behaviors – emerge during a period of development called sexual maturation . Yet , the mechanisms that control when sexual differentiation takes place in the brain are largely unknown . To investigate this , Pereira et al . set out to determine how sex differences arise in the nervous system of C . elegans , a small animal with two sexes , male and hermaphrodite . In particular , Pereira et al . wanted to know which genes cause certain neurons that are present in both sexes to switch to the male-specific form when the worm gets old enough . The experiments revealed that a genetic pathway formed of three genes , let-7 , lin-28 and lin-41 , controls when sexual maturation takes place throughout the worm nervous system . When the worm is young , lin-41 is active and represses a gene called lin-29A . As the animal reaches maturity , let-7 ‘switches off’ lin-41 , and lin-29A gets activated in a subset of neurons . These brain cells then turn on male-specific genes and acquire a shape only found in males . The anatomy of male mutant worms that lack lin-29A is normal , but the animals show features found in hermaphrodites , for example in the way they crawl across a dish . This shows that activating lin-29A may also trigger male-specific behaviors . Switching on sex-specific neuronal circuits at the correct time is essential for animals to develop correctly . The lin-7 and let-28 genes also control when sexual maturation takes place in mammals , so studying these genes in C . elegans could help to understand how male and female brains are shaped during development in other species , and why some diseases affect the sexes differently ."," When worms grow up, some things happen differently depending on whether they're boys or girls. Scientists wanted to know why. They knew that special chemicals called ""miRNAS"" help decide when things like boy worms' brains look like boy brains instead of girl ones. Some miRNASC make worms wait longer before turning into men. Other miRNSAC make them become men faster. But scientists didn't know exactly how these miRNsAC worked together to make sure worms grew up to be either boys or girls. So, scientists looked very closely at where miRNCAS made worms turn into men faster or slower. They found out that another kind of chemical called ""proteins"" helped decide when worms turned into men or women. There are lots of kinds of proteincs in worms, so scientists tried to figure out which ones mattered most. They figured out that one kind of protein, called ""LIN-20"", makes worms become men slowly. And another kind, called LIN 29, makes worm become men quickly. Then, scientists put LIN29 into worms that don't usually become men. Suddenly, those worms became men! That means that LIN49 controls when worm become boys or when they become girls. It's like having a birthday party. If you want everyone to sing ""Happy Birthday,"" you need to tell everyone when to start singing. Sometimes people say ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"" really loud right when the song should start. Everyone else stops singing because they weren't ready yet. That's sort of what happens when LIN -29 gets turned on early. Everything gets messed up because it happens too soon. Or sometimes people don' tsing ""Happppyyyy Birthday!"" at all. Nothing happens because nobody started singing. That's sort what happens whe LIN--29 isn't turned on at all."" Just like how saying ""Happyyy Bithday!"" too early ruins the surprise party, putting LIN --29 too early or too late makes worm babies turn into the wrong kind of worms."
"Sex allows two individuals of a species to combine their genetic information and generate new offspring . As such , and unlike most of the cells that make up an organism , reproductive cells carry DNA that will be passed to the next generation . To prepare for sexual reproduction , reproductive cells undergo a process whereby they give up half of their DNA . Moreover , in many species , reproductive cells undergo dramatic changes in size and shape to become specialized as eggs or sperm . For two decades , research scientists have made use of an antibody that specifically targets and labels reproductive cells in mice and rats , long before they become recognizable as sperm or eggs . However , nothing was known about the protein that this antibody recognizes . Now , Carmell et al . have found that the antibody recognizes a protein called GCNA . This protein was previously thought to be limited to mice and rats . However , GCNA is in fact a member of a far-flung family of proteins that had gone unnoticed by researchers due to their unusual composition and large unstructured regions . Carmell et al . show that this protein family extends beyond rodents and even mammals , and actually exists in all branches of eukaryotic life , including plants and single-celled organisms . In most species examined , the genes encoding these proteins are most active in reproductive cells . The most important next step is to figure out precisely what GCNA proteins are doing in reproductive cells . This will also hopefully explain why these proteins appear to have been conserved for more than 2 billion years , throughout the entire history of eukaryotes ."," Scientists have learned that germ cells (which eventually turn into eggs and sperm) are kept separate from somatic cells (all other cells) in certain kinds of animals. They wanted to know if this separation happened right away or later in life. Using worms, fish, and mouse models, they looked at what happens to germ cells when they divide. They found that even though worms don’t have a special kind of germline cell, the germ cells still seemed to want to stay together. They then looked back even farther in time, to single- celled organisms called green algal. They saw that even in these tiny organisms, germ cells stayed together! Finally, they went even deeper back in time to look at really old organisms that only have one cell. Even these single- cells had something that made germ cells stick together! So, it looks like keeping germ cells separate started very early in life and got better and better as things moved forward through time. Because of this finding, scientists now think that germline cells sticking together helps keep the whole organism healthy. They think that having germ cells separated from other cells keeps the two kinds of cells safe from each other. For example, maybe germ cells have chemicals that would hurt other cells, or maybe other cells have ways of killing germ cells. Either way, both kinds of cell would be protected from being harmed. That would mean that germ cell separation isn’t just good for making babies, but also for protecting the health of the whole body. This idea is pretty cool because it means that germlines have been around for a long time and doing important jobs besides making babies! And it shows us that sometimes things happen for reasons we never thought of before. Sometimes those reasons are even good for us! Who knows? Maybe germline separation is actually why people who live today are alive! That would definitely be pretty cool!"
"In female mammals , eggs made in the ovaries travel to the uterus via tubes called oviducts ( or Fallopian tubes ) . If sperm fertilize these eggs on the way , they complete this journey as early embryos and then implant into the wall of the uterus . As sperm and then newly fertilized embryos travel down these tubes , they encounter fluid inside the oviduct , which is generated by the cells that line the tube . The hormonal changes that occur with the menstrual cycle alter the complexity and cellular composition of the uterus . When an egg is fertilized , further changes in the levels of the hormones , estrogen and progesterone , ensure the uterus becomes receptive to the embryo . However , it remains unknown whether such hormone-mediated signals also regulate the oviduct to support fertilization and early embryo development . To investigate this question , Winuthayanon et al . studied female mice that lack an important estrogen receptor in the cells that line their oviducts and uterus . These mice are infertile . This is partly because most sperm become stuck in the uterus and fail to reach the eggs in the oviduct in order to fertilize them . The oviduct also becomes a hostile environment for both eggs and embryos , as reflected in damaged eggs and the complete loss of all new embryos by two days after fertilization . These embryos die , not because their development fails , but because their outer membrane becomes damaged and breaks apart . Winuthayanon et al . showed that this is due to the persistence of enzymes that form part of the immune system inside the oviduct . These enzymes can degrade proteins and damage cell membranes . The presence of this estrogen receptor on the inner lining of the oviduct thus appears to be crucially important for reproduction ( these effects were not seen when it is removed from other cells of the oviduct ) . The loss of this receptor also reveals the vital role that estrogen plays in suppressing parts of the immune response to ensure the oviduct provides a supportive environment for fertilization and embryo development . These findings could also have future application in the development of new contraceptives and might also shed light on the causes of human infertility ."," Estrogen plays a crucial role in preparing the body for pregnancy. For example, it helps thicken the walls of blood vessels near the placenta, which allows extra oxygen and nutrients to get to the growing fetus. Now, researchers report that estrogen also affects the way the egg travels through the fallopian tube (oviduct) and gets ready for fertilisaton. They made this discovery by studying female mice whose ovidcts (the equivalent of the fall opian tubes) contained too little of a protein called estrogen alpha (ERα). Without enough ERα, the mice had problems getting pregnant. The researchers found that the main reason for this was that the egg and its surrounding cells were not able to move properly through the ovdact. This happened because the egg's outer layer was being broken down faster than usual. The authors think that this breakdown might be caused by chemicals called proteases, which are released by cells in the oiduct. Proteases help dissolve the egg shell during ovulation, allowing the egg to be fertilised. However, they should not be active once the egg enters the oviduct. So, there must be something that usually turns them off. The author think that ERα tells the oividuct cells to stop releasing proteases. When ERα isn't working, the proteases keep going, causing the eggshell to break down earlier than it should. Because the egg is destroyed sooner, it doesn't survive long enough to be picked up by the uterus and prepared for implatntion. The study also found that adding certain chemicals that block proteases to the fluid in which eggs are cultured in the laboratory helped them survive longer. This suggests that blocking proteases could be a way to treat women who have problems conceiving. On the other hand, the authors say that using protease blockers to artifically inflate the lifespan of eggs in the lab might actually hurt a woman's chances of becoming pregnant. That's because the natural process of egg destruction by proteases is important to prepare the body to accept the embroy."
"In female mammals , granulosa cells in the ovaries help egg cells to grow and develop by secreting nutrients and estrogens—the female sex hormones . A protein called FOXL2 helps granulosa cells to develop and functions by binding to the DNA of the cells to switch certain genes either on or off . In humans , mutations in the gene that codes for the FOXL2 protein are associated with granulosa cell tumors and with a loss of female fertility in early adulthood . In addition , if the amount of FOXL2 is artificially reduced in granulosa cells in female mice , the cells take on many of the characteristics of supporting cells found in the testes of males . To investigate in more detail how FOXL2 works , Georges et al . grew mouse granulosa cells in the laboratory to identify the DNA sequences where FOXL2 will bind , and to uncover how this binding affects gene expression . Georges et al . conclude that FOXL2 orchestrates a network involving many different proteins that allows estrogen to be produced and used by granulosa cells; and in doing so these cells maintain their identity as ovarian cells . FOXL2 was also shown to work closely with the receptor proteins that detect the sex hormones , and which help to control whether particular sex-specific genes are switched on or off . One particularly important role of FOXL2 in granulosa cells is that it represses a gene called Sox9 . By repressing Sox9 , the granulosa cells do not transform into their counterparts normally found in testes . Although FOXL2 was previously reported to directly regulate the Sox9 gene , Georges et al . find that it also acts through other molecules , and that there are alternative ways in which it can do so . Although Georges et al . have established some of the ways that FOXL2 functions , this protein can work via other pathways; these will require further investigation to be fully understood ."," Researchers investigated how certain hormones influence the growth of eggs in the body of female mice. To do this, they studied special cells called granulose cells that live in the ovaries and support egg development. First, they looked at how much of a hormone called estradial (shortened to ""E2"") was being made in these granuluse cells. Then, they added extra estradiel to see what effect it had on the cells. Next, they examined how the addition of estrodiol affected the growth and division of granulouse cells. Finally, they tried to figure out why estradieol affects the cells by looking at how it interacts with different parts of the cells' 'genetic instructions"" called genes. Overall, they found that a protein that lives inside the cells called forkhead box L2 (shortend to ""FOXl2) helps to keep the cells healthy by making sure that they respond normally to estradienol. Without FOXl12, the cells did not divide and grow correctly. This means that FOXXL2 helps to protect the health of the granulue cells by helping them to respond to the hormone estradierol. Since these cells are very important for making eggs, this protection is likely very important to help female mices reproduce. Because of this, scientists think that FOXXXX2 might be useful as a way to tell whether someone has problems with their reproduction. More studies are needed to find out if this is true. If it is, knowing about FOXLL2 could help doctors decide if someone needs medical help to get pregnant or stay pregnant. It could also help them choose the best medicine to treat people who cannot get pregnant. In the future, researchers should try to find ways to use FOXLI2 to help women who want to get or stay pregnatn."
"Pheromones are chemicals that are given off by living things and they lead to a range of social responses in others of the same species . These chemical signals , for example , can let an animal know when a suitable mate is near and trigger the release of hormones that encourage the animal to mate . In mammals , an organ found between the roof of the mouth and the nose detects pheromones . This organ contains more than 300 different receptors for these chemicals . However , only a few of these receptors have been matched with the pheromones that they detect . One example is a chemical released by male mice that interacts with a specific nasal receptor and causes a female mouse to arch her back in a way that signals she is ready to mate . One reason that more pheromone-receptor pairs are not known is that pheromones are released in very small quantities , which makes them hard to detect . In an effort to identify more pairs , Haga-Yamanaka et al . took tissue slices from the organ that detects pheromones in mice and then looked for cells that responded to the urine of female mice . Two previously unknown pheromone-receptor pairs were found . One helps male mice detect when a female is present , while the other lets him know if she is ready to mate . Together these two chemicals alert a male mouse to a potential mate and cause him to mount her in order to mate . However , neither chemical is able to trigger this male courtship behavior on its own . The techniques developed by Haga-Yamanaka et al . may , in the future , help identify more pheromone-receptor pairs . The next challenge will be to identify the pathways of nerve cells that integrate the information about pheromones and trigger the courtship behaviors ."," Mice sniff each other's odours to find out what kind of mouse they are dealing with. They can tell if a female mouse is ready to mate because she releases special chemicals from her urine. Now scientists have figured out how these chemicals make male mices behave. They found out that male mouses need to smell two kinds of chemicals to know that a female wants to mate with him. One chemical tells the male mouse that he should only try to mate if the female mouse he smells is female. The other chemical makes the male feel like he needs to mate right away. If the male sniffs just one of these chemicals, he won't want to mate. But if he sniffs both chemicals, then he knows that the female is ready and he feels like he must mate with her. So, the male mouse behaves differently depending on what chemicals he smelles. Sometimes, the chemicals don't always work perfectly so the male might try to sniff again before deciding to mate or he might decide not to mate at all. Scientists think that this way of making decisions works better than having one single chemical do everything. That way, the mouse can react differently depending upon what he smels. And that helps the mouse figure out what to do next. This discovery shows us how important it is to have lots of different things working together to make good choices. Knowing how these different chemicals affect behaviour can help doctors and scientists come up with treatments for people whose brains aren't working properly. For example, some people don' t feel like doing anything because their brains aren’t sending the right messages to their bodies. Maybe figuring out how to fix those messages could help those people start feeling like doing things again. That's why studying stuff like this is really important! It helps us understand how our brains work and how we can make them work better. That knowledge can help us treat diseases and make our lives better."
"Genes are sections of DNA that carry the instructions needed to build other molecules including all the proteins that the cell needs to fulfill its role . The information in the DNA is stored as a code consisting of four chemical bases , often referred to simply as “A” , “C” , “G” and “T” . The order or sequence of these bases determines the role of a protein . Many organisms – including humans – are built of many different types of cells that perform unique roles . Almost all cells carry the same genetic information , but proteins called transcription factors can regulate the activity of genes so that only a relevant subset of genes is switched on at a particular time . Transcription factors glide along DNA and bind to short DNA sequences by attaching to the DNA bases directly or through bridges made up of water molecules . Two physical concepts known as enthalpy and entropy determine the strength of the connection . Enthalpy relates to how strong the chemical bonds that form between the transcription factors and the DNA bases are , compared to a situation where the transcription factor and DNA do not form a complex and bind to water molecules around them . Entropy measures the disorder of the system – the more disordered the solvent and protein-DNA complex are compared to solvent-containing free DNA and protein , the stronger the binding . A water molecule that bridges a DNA base with an amino-acid of a protein contributes to enthalpy , but results in loss of entropy , because the system becomes more ordered since the water molecule can no longer move freely . Most transcription factors can only bind to DNA sequences that are very similar to each other , but some transcription factors can recognize several different kinds of sequences , and until now it was not clear how they could do this . Morgunova et al . studied four different human transcription factors that can each bind to two distinct DNA sequences . The results showed that the transcription factors bound to both DNA sequences with similar strength , but via different mechanisms . For one DNA sequence , an enthalpy-based mechanism essentially ‘froze’ the transcription factor to the DNA through rigid water bridges . The other DNA sequence was bound equally strongly but through moving water molecules , because this increased the entropy of the system . It is possible that these mechanisms could also apply to many other molecules that interact with each other through water-molecule bridges . A better knowledge of the chemical bonds between transcription factors and DNA bases may in future help efforts to develop new treatments that depend on molecules being able to bind to other molecules . In addition , these findings may one day help scientists to predict how strongly two molecules will interact simply by knowing the structures of the molecules involved ."," Transcription factors are proteins that help copy certain parts of the DNA into small pieces of RNA called ""messages"". Some transcription proteins can recognize two different kinds of DNA sequences that are close to each other. By solving the structure of these transcription protein bound to these two different DNA sequences, researchers found that the protein uses two ways to interact with the DNA sequences: one way involves losing entropy (which means losing disorder) and gaining heat, while the other way involves gaining entropy (meaning increasing disorder) even though the strength of the interaction is the same. This finding helps explain why some transcription genes can recognize more than one kind of DNA sequence. Researchers did this experiment by putting the DNA and the protein into water droplets that evaporated slowly so the protein could stick to the DNA. They also checked that the DNA was folded correctly by looking at it with x-ray light. Finally, they looked at the protein-DNA combinations with electron light to get pictures of the protein sticking to the different DNAS. The authors think that this discovery will help scientists learn more about the differences between transcription gene functions. It is important to know how transcriptions function because they play key roles in things like cancer and disease. Knowing how transcriptor genes work can help doctors figure out treatments for diseases caused by problems with transcription. Additionally, knowing how transcrips work can give scientists tools to make tiny changes to the genomes of living things, such as crops. This could let farmers grow more food on less land. Scientists can also use this knowledge to help make sure that living things only grow where they should, such that crops don't spread to natural areas. Overall, learning more about transcription can help solve lots of big problems facing humanity today!. The author did this research with his labmates. They used computer programs to look at the shapes of the proteins and DNAtogether. Then, they put the proteinthat they wanted to study together with the DNAdifferent shapes that it could bindto into tiny water dropletsthat slowly evaporate. While the dropletturned smaller and smaller, the proteinstuck to the DNa. Finally, the authors took pictures ofthe proteins stucktothe DNausing special light."
"Many bacteria , including several that cause diseases in people , have long whip-like appendages called flagella that extend well beyond their cell walls . Flagella can rotate and propel the bacteria through liquids , such as water or blood , and they are constructed primarily from thousands of copies of a single protein called flagellin . When flagella are built , the flagellin proteins are placed in their proper positions by another protein called FliD , several copies of which form a cap on the end of flagella . Without FliD , bacteria cannot properly assemble flagella and , thus , can no longer swim; this also hinders their ability to cause disease . Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein , down to the level of its individual atoms , can provide unique insights into how the protein operates . However , no one had resolved the structure of a FliD protein from any bacterium to this level of detail before . Now , Postel et al . report the high-resolution structure of a large fragment of FliD from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The structure reveals that parts of this FliD protein are shaped like parts of other proteins from which flagella are constructed , including the flagellin protein that FliD places into position . Some parts of the FliD protein are also very flexible and these parts of the protein are responsible for holding numerous FliD proteins together as a cap . Finally , Postel et al . saw that six copies of FliD bind to one another to form a protein complex on the end of flagella . This last finding was particularly unexpected since it was thought that all FliD proteins formed five-membered cap complexes , an assumption that was based largely on studies of FliD from another bacterium called Salmonella . The current structure covers about half of the FliD protein , and so the next challenge is to determine the structure of the full-length protein . An improved understanding of the structure of FliD may , in future , help researchers to design drugs that stop bacteria from building flagella and , therefore , from swimming and causing disease ."," Flagella are tiny hair-like appendages that help bacteria move around. They are composed of long strands of proteinthat twist around themselves to form helices. The proteins making up the flagella need to be delivered to the right place at the right time, and this job is done by another set of proteinsthat guide the flagelin proteins where they need to go. One of these guiding proteins is called FliDFiguring out what this protein does and how it works is the focus of this study. The authors used a variety of techniques including x-ray crystallographyto figure out the structureof FliDPromising initial results suggested that Flin might work like another type of protein called a dimer.However, further testing showed that FiliDactually worked differently.Instead of forming pairs,FliDforms groups of six.The reason for this is still unknown,but the authors think that changing the number of proteinsi nside the group might allow the group to adjust to different situations.Overall,the authors conclude that FiniDhas a special way of workingthat allows it to adapt to different kinds of flagella.Fig. 1A cartoon of a flagellated bacterium, with the flagelle highlighted in purple. Salmonella enterica is shown here, though the principles apply generally to flagellate bacteria. Fig. 2A schematic diagram of the flagello machinery.

"Tiny Gram-negative bacteria are one of humankind's deadliest foes , causing infections of wounds and the bloodstream that are very hard to treat . Many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to several common antibiotics , and the few treatments available that can successfully kill the bacteria are often also toxic to the patients . Understanding how these bacteria elude antibiotics could help scientists develop better , less toxic treatments . Most bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall that helps protect the bacteria and gives them structure . Many broad-spectrum antibiotics , including penicillin and vancomycin , work by interfering with how this protective wall is built from molecules called peptidoglycans . However , Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that prevents many antibiotics from reaching the cell wall , and so the antibiotics are unable to kill the bacteria . The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is made up of sugars and fatty molecules called lipids . Recently , scientists discovered a mutation that interferes with the movement of the lipid and sugar molecules that make up the outer membrane , which compromises this protective layer and makes the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics . To learn more about how this mutation interferes with the defenses of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Grabowicz et al . searched for compensating mutations that can counteract it and restore the antibiotic resistance of these mutant bacteria . The search revealed that a mutation in a gene called waaL increases E . coli's resistance to vancomycin , but not to other antibiotics . The gene encodes an enzyme , and the mutant form of the enzyme attaches some peptidoglycans to the surface of the outer membrane instead of incorporating them into the cell wall . The stray peptidoglycans on the cell's surface act as decoys , binding to vancomycin and keeping the drug from reaching its true target—the cell wall . The decoy strategy is similar to a mechanism used by Gram-positive bacteria—which lack a protective outer membrane—to resist vancomycin treatment , which also involves creating sites that bind the drug and keep it from its target . Vancomycin is not currently used clinically to treat E . coli or other Gram-negative infections because these bacteria are naturally quite resistant for other reasons . However , Grabowicz et al . 's findings do demonstrate how quickly bacteria can adapt and produce new defenses to antibiotics when old strategies fail ."," Researchers discovered a special kind of bacteria that makes its cell wall stronger by sticking LPS molecules on its outside. They named this bacteria ""waaL"". To find out why waaLa was making its cell stronger, researchers looked at the LPS that was stuck on the outside of the bacteria. They noticed that instead of having the usual sugar molecule attached to it, there was another kind of sugar molecules attached to LPS. When they put this extra sugar molecular on the LSP molecules that came from normal bacteria, the LPs became much bigger and heavier. Scientists think that this big LPS helps the bacteria grow faster. They also found that this special LPS helped the bacteria survive better when treated with a drug called vancomcycin. Vancomcycine kills bacteria by stopping them from growing. So, the scientists think that the extra sugars on the bacteria’s cell wall help the bacteria resist vancomycine. This means that even though the bacteria are sick, they still grow and divide normally. This discovery is important because it tells us that sometimes bad things happen for a reason. Sometimes, the bad thing can actually turn out to be good! That is really amazing! And maybe, someday doctors can learn how to use this knowledge to fight diseases. Maybe they can give patients drugs that will make their bodies strong again. Or maybe they can teach people how to eat foods that will stop them from getting sick in the first place. That would be great! Wouldn’t you love to never get sick again? I sure would! But until then, we need to keep learning more about how our bodies work and how to fix them when they break. That is science! And it is pretty awesome! Science rules! 👨‍💻📢🔬🎫🧪"
"TRPM3 belongs to a family of channel proteins that allow sodium and calcium ions to enter cells by forming pores in cell membranes . TRPM3 is found on the cell membranes of nerve cells; when ions flow into the nerves through the TRPM3 pores it triggers an electrical impulse . TRPM3 is responsible for helping us to detect heat , and mice without this protein find it difficult to sense painfully hot temperatures . Mice lacking TRPM3 also respond to other kinds of pain differently . Normally , a mouse with an injured paw becomes more sensitive to warm and hot temperatures , but this does not happen in mice that do not have TRPM3 . When activated , other proteins called G-protein coupled receptors ( or GPCRs for short ) can make some members of this family of channel proteins more or less likely to open their pore . This in turn increases or decreases the flow of ions through the pore , respectively . Yet it was not clear if GPCRs also affect TRPM3 channels on the membranes of nerve cells . Quallo et al . have now discovered that “switching on” different GPCR proteins in sensory nerve cells from mice greatly reduces the flow of calcium ions though TRPM3 channels . The experiments made use of two pain-killing drugs , namely morphine and baclofen , and a molecule called neuropeptide Y to activate different GPCRs . GPCRs interact with a group of small proteins called G-proteins that , when activated by the receptor , split into two subunits , known as the α subunit and the βγ subunit . Once detached these subunits are free to act as messengers and interact with other proteins in the cell membrane . Quallo et al . found that TRPM3 is one of a small group of proteins that interact with the βγ subunits of the G-protein , which can explain how “switching on” GPCRs reduces the activity of TRPM3 . Two independent studies by Dembla , Behrendt et al . and Badheka , Yudin et al . also report similar findings . There is currently a need to find more effective treatments for people suffering from long-term pain conditions and it has become clear that TRPM3 channels are involved in sensing both pain and temperature . These new findings show that drugs already used in the treatment of pain can dramatically change how TRPM3 works . These results might help scientists to find drugs that work in a similar way to dial down the activity of TRPM3 and to combat pain . Though first it will be important to confirm these new findings in human nerve cells ."," Opioids are drugs that come from natural sources like plants and fungi. They include things like heroin, codeine, and morphine. Some types of opioids act on special kinds of proteinthat are called G protein beta gamma subunits. These subunits can change the way some proteins work. For example, there are proteins that make people feel pain. There are also proteins in the bodies of insects and worms that make them want to go away from things that hurt them. Both of these proteins can be changed by the G protein subunits so that they don’t work very well anymore. This means that someone might feel less pain after taking an opioiddrug. Scientists think that this happens because the drug makes the G proteins stop working. If scientists learn more about how the G beta gama subunits work, they might be ableto find better ways to treat pain. That would be good news!. The authors of this article studied how the beta gamsubunits work in the proteins of rats. They looked at how the subunits affected the proteinsthat make rodents feel pain. Then, they looked at what happened when the subunitsprevented the proteinsnfrom making rodents want to run away from painful things. Finally, they tested whether the substances that comefrom plants and mushrooms that are related to opioidosubstancescould also affect the proteinsi nthis way. They found that they could! So, this means that scientists might be closer to findingbetter treatments for pain. And, maybe someday, they will know why opiodrugswork the way they do. Thatwould be really cool!. But first, they need to keep studying how the proteini swork. That takes a lot of time and effort. But everyone hopes that it will all be worth it in the end."
"Immune cells called CD4 T cells help the body build immunity to infections caused by bacteria and viruses , or after vaccination . Receptor proteins on the outside of the cells recognize pathogens , foreign molecules called antigens , or vaccine antigens . Vaccine antigens are usually inactivated bacteria or viruses , or fragments of these pathogens . After recognizing an antigen , CD4 T cells develop into memory CD4 T cells ready to defend against future infections with the pathogen . People who have never been exposed to a pathogen , or have never been vaccinated against it , may nevertheless have preexisting memory cells ready to defend against it . This happens because CD4 T cells can recognize multiple targets , which enables the immune system to be ready to defend against both new and familiar pathogens . Elias , Meysman , Bartholomeus et al . wanted to find out whether having preexisting memory CD4 T cells confers an advantage for vaccine-induced immunity . Thirty-four people who were never exposed to hepatitis B or vaccinated against it participated in the study . These individuals provided blood samples before vaccination , with 2 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine , and at 3 time points afterward . Using next generation immune sequencing and machine learning techniques , Elias et al . analyzed the individuals’ memory CD4 T cells before and after vaccination . The experiments showed that preexisting memory CD4 T cells may determine vaccination outcomes , and people with more preexisting memory cells develop quicker and stronger immunity after vaccination against hepatitis B . This information may help scientists to better understand how people develop immunity to pathogens . It may guide them develop better vaccines or predict who will develop immunity after vaccination ."," When someone gets a vaccine, their body makes special cells called memory T lymphocytes that remember what to fight against. If the person comes across that thing again, their memory T-cells attack it quickly. Sometimes, before a person gets a virus vaccine, they already have memory T‐cells that match the virus because they've seen something very similar to it before. This happens because sometimes people get infected with things that are closely related to the virus in the vaccine. For example, children often catch a cold virus before getting the measles shot. Because of this, scientists wanted to know if having these kinds of memory T‑cells helps or hurts when fighting off the virus that the vaccine is trying to protect against. They found that having these memory T­cells helped kids build good protection faster against hepatitus B, a liver infection. They also figured out ways to tell which memory T¬cells came from coming into contact with the virus before and which ones came from the vaccine by looking at the shape of little pieces of their DNA that stick out (called TCRs). By knowing which kind of memory cells a person had, doctors might be able tell if a vaccine will work really well for that person or not. This knowledge could help doctors decide which vaccines to give to people who are about to come into contactwith things they might be immune to already. It could also help make vaccines stronger so that everyone benefits from them.

"Protein filaments called microtubules help move cargo around inside cells . Chromosomes , which contain the cell’s genetic blueprints , are the microtubule’s most precious cargo . Before a cell divides , microtubules grow from the ends of the dividing cell towards the middle , where they attach to the chromosomes that are lined up along the centerline . Then the microtubules shrink and drag the chromosomes back to the opposite ends of the cell . This allows each of the new cells to get one copy of each chromosome . When the microtubules are growing , a molecule called guanosine triphosphate ( or GTP ) is attached to the proteins at the end of the filament . This acts like a cap and protects the microtubule from shrinking . Later a chemical reaction converts GTP into GDP ( short for guanosine diphosphate ) . Without the protective GTP cap , the microtubule quickly shrinks . At the same time , the proteins that make up the microtubule also change shape . In the microtubule , the proteins adopt a straight shape when GTP is attached . The proteins favor a different shape in the microtubule when GDP is attached . However , it is unclear if or how these shape changes contribute to how a microtubule grows or shrinks . Geyer et al . now show how this shape shifting can influence microtubule shrinking , by first identifying a mutation in yeast microtubule proteins that cause the proteins to remain straight even when GDP is attached . Next , powerful microscopes were used to make time-lapse videos of the mutated microtubules . This allowed Geyer et al . to observe how the mutated microtubules behaved and compare this to the behavior of normal microtubules . The experiments revealed that the mutated microtubules were less likely to begin shrinking than typical microtubules . The mutated microtubules also shrunk more slowly . These findings indicate that the shape changes control the speed of shrinking and frequency of entering the shrinking phase . These new details about the control of microtubule growth and shrinkage may help scientists studying how cell division happens in both healthy and cancerous cells ."," Microtubles are long, hollow polymers composed of tubulin proteins arranged like a helical ladder. They play important roles inside living cells, where they serve as tracks for motor proteins and scaffolds for organelles. Scientists know that the arrangement of tubulins in microtublules changes depending on what kind of nucleotides are attached to them. But exactly how this happens isn’t well understood. Now, researchers have discovered that a particular mutation makes microtubeules grow much more slowly than usual. Further investigation showed that this slow growth is caused because the mutated tubulines don’t change their arrangement properly once the nucleotidesswitch from GTP to GPD. So, the mutant tubuline proteins are stuck in a special arrangement that doesn’t allow the microtubble to shrink or switch back to growing mode. This discovery shows that the way nucleotidseregulate the arrangementof tubulintypes is very important for how microtuberules behave. It might also help scientists understand why some kinds of cells need microtulbes to stop growing quickly. And it could help doctors figure out ways to treat diseases that involve abnormal microtullbe behavior. Finally, it could give scientists clues about how to use artificial microtulle drugs to treat other diseases. Overall, this finding is exciting because it gives us a better idea of how tiny molecular details influence how microtuules behave inside living things. It also reminds us that sometimes seemingly bad things, like genetic mutations, can actually teach us a lot about how nature works! Science is pretty cool like that!. The authors studied how a mutation affects the behavior of microtucles, which are long polymmers made up of tublinproteins arranged in a helix. They found that a mutated version of tubliuncalled T283A grew microtuioles much slower than normal ones. Further analysis showed that the slow growth came from the fact that the T293A tubulincouldn’t switch its arrangement properly when the nucleotiidea changed from GPTto GDP. This means that the regular switching of the tubulincechanges its arrangement, which is important for making microtulioles grow or shrink. The authors think this discovery will help them learn more about how microtluleswork inside living systems. It could also help doctors come up with treatments for diseases that cause abnormal growth of microtlues"
"To produce a protein , a stretch of DNA must first be transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . The genetic information copied from the DNA is then read three letters at a time , in groups called codons . Each codon either encodes a particular amino acid to be added into a protein or provides further instructions: ‘start codons’ mark the beginning of a protein; ‘stop codons’ mark its end . The DNA between these two points is called an open reading frame ( or ORF ) —however , not all ORFs produce proteins . Most proteins are made of several hundred amino acids , but the genomes of animals contain thousands of ORFs that would generate much smaller proteins made of fewer than 100 amino acids , if they were translated . It is , however , unclear how many of these small ORFs are converted into mRNA molecules and functional proteins . Ribosomes are large molecular machines that translate the code in mRNA molecules and join together the appropriate amino acids in the right order to make a protein . Ribosome profiling is a technique that identifies which mRNA molecules are translated into proteins by determining the sequences of all the mRNA molecules bound to ribosomes at a particular moment . The mRNA sequences can then be compared with the sequence of the whole genome to work out which ORFs they correspond to . Ribosome profiling has been used to detect translated small ORFs , but the method yields a relatively high false positive rate as some mRNAs can bind to ribosomes without being translated . To better detect small protein-producing ORFs , Aspden et al . developed a technique based on ribosome profiling called Poly-Ribo-Seq . The method takes advantage of the fact that during active translation , clusters of multiple ribosomes , called polysomes , bind mRNAs . Poly-Ribo-Seq isolates these polysomes and determines the sequence bound by each of the ribosomes , thereby reducing the number of false positives . Applying Poly-Ribo-Seq to cells from the fruit fly Drosophila allowed Aspden et al . to identify two types of short ORF . The first type codes for proteins that are around 80 amino acids long and are translated with the same efficiency as larger ORFs . The sequences of these ORFs are found in other species , match at least in part sequences of known functional ORFs , and the proteins produced are found in specific locations inside cells . These small proteins may contribute to membrane integrity or function . Together , these properties suggest that these mRNAs create functional small proteins . The second pool consists of very small ORFs ( ‘dwarf smORFs’ ) that code for around 20 amino acids , which are not translated so often and do not show many similarities with other species . As the findings of Aspden et al . suggest that a large fraction of Drosophila small ORFs are translated into proteins , the next challenge will be to determine the roles of these small proteins in cells ."," There are lots of tiny pieces of code inside our bodies that tell cells to make certain proteins. Some scientists think that these tiny pieces may make very small proteins that play special roles in cells. They wanted to find out if these small pieces of codes really make anything and if so, what those things are. So, they looked at all the tiny pieces in fruit flies and saw that most of them did make something. But, there wasn’t enough information to know exactly what those tiny proteins were doing. Even though scientists don’t fully understand why these tiny proteinsthey call them“smORFstoo often, they think that they are pretty common throughout living creatures. And now we know that there are much more smORFS than we thought! That means that there must be lots of different kinds of tiny proteinsi.e., there aren’t just one or two. Just like regular proteins, these tiny ones probably have jobs to do in cells. Maybe someday we’ll learn what they are! For now, scientists know that these smORFTiny Proteinsare being made because they can see evidence of them. They also know that they seem to be made in the usual way, just like regularproteins. They also found that some of the tiny proteinsnamed“dwarfs”were being made in places where you wouldn’t expect them. Those places are called“non-cording regions”. It isn’t clear yet what those little guys are doing there. But since they look like regular tiny proteinthey probably have a job to do too!Just like big proteins need to be attached to a part of the cell membrane to do their job, these little ones probably need to get stuck to something too. Scientists hope that figuring out where these tiny proteinshave to gowill give them ideas about what they do. Then maybe we’ ll learn what their jobs are!"
"Our sense of touch depends upon receptors in our skin that send signals to the brain about the objects with which we interact . Different types of touch receptors respond in different ways when we grasp and manipulate objects; for example , by altering the strength of their response or its timing . Saal et al . have now investigated how neurons in a part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex , which processes touch signals from the hand , respond to the information from the different receptor types . First , recordings were made of the electrical activity of the touch receptors and the neurons in the brain of monkeys . Using this data , Saal et al . built computer models that allow the response of neurons in the brain to be predicted from the responses of the touch receptors . The models showed that signals from different types of touch receptors shape the response of neurons in the brain in different ways . One receptor type controls how strong a neuron’s response will be , while another one controls the precise timing of the response . Further investigation revealed that this way of combining the signals from the different receptors preserves as much information as possible about objects and thereby helps the brain to process information acquired by touch quickly and efficiently . Future experiments will examine how touch is represented in two structures that lie between the receptors and the somatosensory cortex: one in the brainstem , the other in a brain region called the thalamus ."," Touch sensation comes from many kinds of nerves that react in slightly different ways. How does the brain combine information from these different nerves? Researchers built a computer program to mimic the way that nerve messages get sent to the brain. Then they looked at how the brain responds to touch. They found that different parts of the response come from different kinds of nerve. Some kinds of touch nerve react quickly, but don’t last long. Other kinds of nervous react slowly, but keep going for longer. By combining these two kinds of message, the brain gets good information about what happened. This gives us clues about how the sense of feeling works. Next researchers want to look at how this happens in people who feel things badly, like people with autism spectrum disorder. That might help them figure out how to treat people who struggle with touch. That would improve quality of life for lots of people. 1) What problem were scientists trying to solve? Scientists wanted to know how the brains of living animals deal with information coming from different sources. 2) Why is this research important? Understanding how the senses work is important for helping people with problems like autism. 3) What did scientists actually do? Scientist made a computer model of how nerves send messages to the brains. They looked at the kind of messages that came back from the model. 4) Did the experiment work? Yes, the model worked. 5) What were the most interesting results? Scientific found that nerves that respond fast but don't last very long give useful information. Slow nerves that last longer gave less useful information, but helped fill in details. 6) Any limitations? Yes. Computer model didn't include everything that happens in real brains. 7) What questions still need answering? Will the ideas from the computer model help doctors treat patients with autistic disorders? 8) Where can readers go to learn more? https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55227-w"
"Unlike other cells in the body , brain cells contain almost no energy reserves and rely on blood vessels for continuous supply of oxygen . A change in the brain’s activity can cause these blood vessels to either dilate or constrict , which alters the supply to match the change in demand . However , it is not known which signals cause these changes in the blood vessels . Previous studies have shown that individual blood vessels in an intact brain tend to dilate when the brain’s activity increases , and constrict when brain activity is inhibited . However , these studies were based on correlations , and there was no direct evidence that the inhibitory cells cause blood vessels to constrict . Uhlirova , Kılıç et al . now provide such evidence . The experiments made use of mice that had been genetically modified such that the excitatory or inhibitory nerve cells in their brains could be selectively activated by shining a blue light on the brain’s surface . The vessels in the outer millimeter of the gray matter of each mouse’s brain were imaged in detail , both before and after the blue light was used to activate the nerve cells . The experiments reveal that both excitatory and inhibitory nerve cells can cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate . However , blood vessels in the brain will only constrict in response to inhibitory nerve cells . Uhlirova , Kılıç et al . went on to identify a molecule called Neuropeptide Y ( or NPY short ) as a signal that triggers the constriction of the blood vessels . This signaling molecule is released by a specific sub-type of inhibitory nerve cell and it binds to a receptor protein on the brain’s blood vessels to make them constrict . These findings suggest that NPY and its receptor on blood vessels may offer promising targets for drugs to treat diseases of the brain’s blood vessels . Further studies are now needed to identify the signals responsible for the dilation of blood vessels in the brain ."," Scientists wanted to know exactly how blood vessels in the brain react to messages sent by brain cells. They discovered that certain brain cells send a message to make blood vessels shrink, while others send a different kind of message to let blood vessels grow bigger again. They think this special kind of communication happens through a chemical message called neuropeptides. They believe this discovery will help explain why pictures taken inside the brain show less oxygen sometimes when people are doing tasks that require thinking. They hope this knowledge will lead to ways to treat problems with blood flow in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease or stroke. They also want to try to use this special communication to improve the pictures seen in something called ""functional magnetic resonance"" imaging, which shows where people are focusing their attention. Finally, they think this kind of special communication might be useful for treating other problems too, like heart attacks and strokes. They did all this work on mice, but they think it probably works the same way in human brains because people have the same kind of brain cells and chemicals. They used tiny lasers to talk to just one kind of cell in the mouse brain and watched what happened to blood vessels around it. Then they used special cameras to watch how blood flow changed after talking to different kinds of cells. Next, they used tiny needles to put special chemicals into the mouse's brain to make some cells stop sending messages altogether. That made the blood vessels stay small forever. They say this could help doctors figure out what parts of your brain are causing you to feel sick or tired. They want to keep working on finding ways to fix things so that people don't get sick or hurt. They are pretty sure there are lots more secrets left to discover! They think figuring out those secrets will help them find ways to heal people faster and make them stronger. They would really like to do that someday."
"Many growth factors and hormones instruct cells to act in particular ways – for example , to divide , specialize or migrate – by binding to proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases on the surface of the cell . Receptor tyrosine kinases comprise a region that binds to the signaling molecules outside the cell ( the receptor domain ) and a region that interacts with and modifies other proteins within the cell ( the kinase domain ) . When a growth factor or hormone binds to the receptor domain , the receptor domains of two identical receptor tyrosine kinases form a dimeric complex , bringing the kinase domains close together so that they can activate each other . This activation initiates a long chain of protein-protein interactions that leads to a cellular response . Some mutations that occur in the kinase domain cause the kinase to frequently sample the activated state without needing to bind to a signaling molecule . This can lead to cancer or growth disorders . It is not known how these mutations allow the kinase domain to bypass the control mechanisms that prevent it from activating at the wrong time . Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase in which many disease-causing mutations have been identified in the kinase domain . Chen , Marsiglia et al . have now used the human form of the FGF receptor to investigate how some of these mutations affect kinase structure and activity . The structures of normal and mutant forms of the FGF receptor were determined using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Combining these results with activity data from the diseased receptors revealed four key interdependent sites in the protein that play essential roles in maintaining the receptors in an inhibited state . Disease-causing mutations are generally located in these sites , and take advantage of their interdependence to make the kinase active more frequently , even when the receptor domain is not bound to a signaling molecule . Chen , Marsiglia et al . suggest that these sites may act in the same way in other receptor tyrosine kinases , as these proteins have many similarities in their structures . The findings reveal important regions within the kinase domain that could be targeted by inhibitors to prevent the harmful effects of disease-causing mutations . Future studies will be needed to understand in more detail how interactions between the key sites change the activity of the kinases ."," Scientists have discovered a new way to study how different parts of a protein affect each other's behavior. They did this by looking at how changes in different parts affected the ability of the whole protein to do its job. To do this, they looked at how changing one part of the molecule changed the properties of another part of it. They found that there are actually four separate places where changes happen, and that these places work together to keep the protein turned off until it should be switched on. This finding explains why previous attempts to change just one of these places had failed to completely switch off the protein. The researchers think that this kind of regulation might be happening in other kinds of proteins too. Understanding how proteins like this work could help doctors find ways to fix problems with them. It could also help us learn how to make better drugs that target these proteins. Finally, studying how these protections break down could teach us about what goes wrong in diseases related to these proteINS. Overall, this discovery opens up lots of exciting questions about how proteases like this one work! And how they go wrong in disease. Answering these questions could give us new ways to treat patients who suffer from these diseases. That's why it's really important to continue learning more about them!.

"Each nerve cell in the brain of a mammal communicates with about 1 , 000 other nerve cells in a complex network . Nerve cells ‘talk’ to each other via structures called synapses that connect the nerve cells together . The number of synapses in the brain is enormous – for example , a human brain contains about one quadrillion synapses . One technique that can be used to look at the synapses in the brain is called 3D electron microscopy . The huge number of synapses in an image makes it impractical for researchers to manually label them . However , current methods that use computers to automatically label synapses work most accurately only on images that are so detailed that they cover only very small volumes of the brain ( much less than 1 cubic millimeter ) . Staffler et al . have now developed a new method , called SynEM , that makes it possible for computers to do all the work of finding the synapses in larger volumes of the brain . Without any input from researchers , SynEM can correctly identify connections between nerve cells 97% of the time , which is far more successful than any other current computer-based approach . Importantly , SynEM also automatically indicates which nerve cells are connected by a given synapse , providing a map of “who talks to whom” across the brain . Together with SynEM , methods that track the cable-like structures ( called neurites ) that nerve cells grow to find other nerve cells are already allowing us to map the communication networks in the brain . In the far future Staffler et al . hope that such mappings will become so routine that entire human brains could be studied , perhaps to investigate how diseases affect them ."," Researchers have created software that helps them quickly figure out which parts of brain tissue go together. They did this because brains are very complicated and scientists needed a way to map out connections between different parts of the brain without looking at every tiny piece of tissue. Scientists know what synapsing look like, so the researchers focused on finding places where little threads coming off of one part of the tissue touch other parts of tissue in lots of different ways. By doing this, the researchers figured out which pieces of tissue should be connected to each others. The software worked really well! It helped the scientists figure out how different parts in the brain are connected faster than they ever could before. And since the software works so well, maybe someday scientists will be able to use it to learn even more about how different pieces of brain matter are connected to make us who we are. That would be pretty cool! But first, scientists need to try the software on other kinds of brain samples to make sure it still works just as well. Then, after that, we might finally get a chance to see what makes us special. Or maybe we won’t. Either way, it’ll be fun trying to find out! Science is awesome!

"Most people sleep for around seven or eight hours at night , but if there is something important or interesting to do – for example , taking care of a baby , finishing a task before a deadline , or watching an entertaining movie – we may stay up late . In other words , sleep is regulated by motivational states . The drive to sleep accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep . Thus sleep and other motivational drives compete to decide whether we sleep or engage in other important or interesting activities . The idea that sleep and sex drives might compete with each other is intuitive , but had not been studied experimentally . Machado , Afonso et al . have now studied how this competition determines the behavior of male fruit flies . The presence of a female fly usually keeps a male fly awake at night . However , a male that has recently mated several times ( and has low sex drive ) or one that was sleep deprived ( and has high sleep drive ) ignores the female and goes to sleep . Further investigation revealed a small number of previously unknown neurons ( termed MS1 ) are required for sexual arousal to overcome the male’s desire to sleep . These neurons do not belong to a circuit that is known to be important for male sexual behavior , but they do communicate with that circuit using a neurotransmitter called octopamine . This communication suppresses sleep and promotes courtship . The next steps will be to identify the specific neurons that communicate directly with the MS1 neurons and to determine whether MS1 neurons have a direct role in regulating sex drive . Investigating these details will help us to understand more generally how competing drives influence behavioral choices ."," Sleep and sexual desire are two basic instincts that every person experiences. Sometimes, though, people feel like sleeping less because of something else that they want to do instead! For instance, men might stay up late to watch TV or talk with friends rather than going to bed early. But what happens when someone wants to sleep but cannot? Researchers wanted to find out how the brain knows when to sleep and when to wake up depending on what we want to accomplish. They discovered a special group of brain cells that tell us when it’s time to sleep or wake up again. These cells communicate with another type of brain cell that helps decide when it is time to mate. By turning off the first kind of braincells, the researchers saw that male fruit flies slept much less than usual. On the otherhand, turning off cells that communicate with the first ones made male fruitflies sleep more. Finally, the scientists turned off both sets of cells and found that the male fruit fly slept even less than before. So, it seems that the brain uses certain chemicals to figure out what we need to do and then decides whether we should rest or get busy doing something else! This discovery could help doctors understand why some people have trouble falling asleep sometimes. It could also teach us about mental disorders that affect how much people sleep, like depression. And maybe, it could even lead to new ways to treat insomnia! That’s pretty amazing! Just imagine being able to stay awake all night without drinking coffee or taking drugs. Sounds perfect, right?! Well, who knows...maybe someday science will figure out a way to let us do exactly that!

"A small number of signaling systems control how an animal develops from a single cell into a complex organism made up of many different cell types . Signals pass back and forth between cells , switching genes on and off to direct the development of tissues and organs . One of these signaling systems , called Notch , is so ancient that it appears in nearly all multicellular organisms . A cell sends a Notch signal using proteins called Delta or Jagged ligands that span membrane of the cell , so that part of the protein sits inside the cell and part remains outside . To change the behavior of another cell , the ligands bind to proteins called Notch receptors that span the membrane of the receiving cell . Mammals have two types of Delta ligand , two types of Jagged ligand and four types of Notch receptor . Cells in different tissues display different combinations of these eight proteins . Two Delta ligands called DLL1 and DLL4 often appear together in developing organisms . Some tissues need both and some only the one or the other . In some cases one ligand can compensate if the other is missing , but in others not . It was not clear why this is , or which parts of the proteins are responsible . Tveriakhina et al . used mouse cells to investigate how DLL1 and DLL4 interact with two Notch receptors , called NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 . The results of these experiments show that while DLL1 can bind and activate both Notch receptors equally , DLL4 prefers to partner with NOTCH1 . To find out which parts of the ligands are responsible for this selectivity , Tveriakhina et al . created hybrid ligands that contained a mixture of regions from DLL1 and DLL4 . These suggest that the different binding preferences depend on parts of the ligands that sit outside cells and that lie outside the known sites of binding contact with the Notch receptors . Further experiments studied mice that had been engineered to produce hybrid ligands as replacements for DLL1 . A hybrid ligand consisting of the part of DLL1 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL4 found inside cells generated Notch signals in the tissue that depended on the activity of DLL1 . However , a hybrid consisting of the part of DLL4 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL1 found inside cells did not , showing that in developing mice the parts that sit outside the cells contribute to the different functions of DLL1 and DLL4 . Overall , the results presented by Tveriakhina et al . show that interactions between specific ligands and receptors play important roles in how mammals develop . Further efforts to understand which parts of the ligands affect selectivity could ultimately allow researchers to develop ways to modify how ligands and receptors interact . Such “molecular engineering” strategies could enable cell responses to be precisely controlled by pairing designer ligand-receptor pairs to develop cell-based therapies ."," Researchers wanted to figure out why two proteins called delta-like 1 and delta-Like 4 work differently in the body. They discovered that the way these protections work depends on where you are in your body. So, researchers made copies of parts of these two protections and put them into other protections. These ""copied"" protections worked just like the original ones! But, when scientists changed just a few places in the copied protection, the protections did not work the same way anymore. Scientists think that these special places in these proteinations are what makes them work differently. Overall, this research shows that different parts of a big protein can affect how it works in the end. This discovery might help doctors find ways to fix problems caused by these proteases. That might help treat diseases like cancer. Future research should look at exactly how these proteactions work and how they are connected to things like cancer and other illnesses. This could help develop better medicines. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of differential functions of Dll1 and 4. The identification of the regions in Dll4 that confer selective activation of Notch1 over Notch2 establishes a framework for future investigations aimed at understanding the molecular determinants of Notching. The finding that the Dsl domain determines ligand selectivity opens up new avenues of investigation into the structure-function relationship of the Notch signalling pathway. The observation that the interaction of the ligand with the receptive portion of the EGF repeats contributes to the overall stability of the complex adds a new dimension to our understanding of the molecular details of Notched signalling. The ability to generate chimerical ligands that recapitulates the biological behaviour of the parental proteins allows for the creation of a library of mutant ligands to probe the molecular interactions between the various components of the signalling complex. Such libraries can serve as useful tools to screen for pharmaceuticals that inhibit Notch activation."
"Capillaries form branching networks that surround all cells of the body . They allow oxygen and nutrient exchange between blood and tissue , but this is not their only role . Capillaries in the brain form a tight barrier that prevents components carried in the blood from easily reaching the brain compartment . They also detect the activity of neurons and trigger on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain . This role , revealed only recently , depends upon ion channels on the surface of the capillary cells . Active neurons release potassium ions , which open a type of ion channel called Kir2 . 1 that allows potassium inside the cell to flow out . This process is repeated in neighboring capillary cells until it reaches an upstream vessel , where it causes the vessel to relax and increase the blood flow . Kir2 . 1 channels sit astride the membranes of capillary cells , where they can interact with other membrane molecules . One such molecule , called PIP2 , plays several roles in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of cells . It also physically interacts with channels in the membrane , including Kir2 . 1 channels . If PIP2 levels are low , Kir2 . 1 channel activity decreases . Here , Harraz et al . discovered that capillary cells contain another type of ion channel , called TRPV4 , which is also regulated by PIP2 . But unlike Kir2 . 1 , its activity increases when PIP2 levels drop . Moreover , TRPV4 channels allow sodium and calcium ions to flow into the cell , which has an effect opposite to that of potassium flowing out of the cell . Capillary cells also have receptor proteins called GqPCRs that are activated by chemical signals released by active neurons in the brain . GqPCRs break down PIP2 , so their activity turns Kir2 . 1 channels off and TRPV4 channels on . This resets the system so that it is ready to respond to new signals from active neurons . GqPCRs work as molecular switches to control the balance between Kir2 . 1 and TRPV4 channels and turn brain blood flow up and down . GqPCRs and ion channels that depend on PIP2 can also be found in other types of cells . These findings could reveal clues about how signals are switched on and off in different cells . Understanding the role of PIP2 in signaling could also unveil what happens when signaling go wrong ."," Blood vessels must adjust their size quickly to meet changing needs of the body. To do this, they rely on special cells called endothetial cells that communicate with nearby nerve cells. Scientists discovered that some nerve cells cause endothetic cells to make potassium, which makes blood vessels relax. Other nerve cells remove something else, which lets blood vessels contract. Both things happen very fast. But sometimes, the nerve cells don’t work right, and blood vessels get too big or too small. So scientists looked for ways to fix it. They found that a kind of fatty oil called phosphoinositide PIP 2 helps keep blood vessels the right size. And another kind of oil called arachidonic acid causes problems. The scientists hope that finding out more about how these oils work together will help us find ways to treat illnesses like high blood pressure.

"Animals often sniff each other as a form of greeting to communicate with each other through chemical signals in their body odors . However , in humans this form of behavior is considered taboo , especially between strangers . Scientists argue that , in spite of our efforts to avoid being ‘smelly’ , we may actually smell each other without being aware that we do so . Here , Frumin et al . first put on latex gloves and then shook hands with volunteers to collect samples of their odor . Chemical analysis of the gloves found that a handshake alone was sufficient to transfer the volunteers' odor . These odors were made of chemicals that are similar to ones that animals smell when sniffing each other . Therefore , when we shake hands with a stranger , it is possible that we may inadvertently smell the stranger's chemical signals . To address this possibility , Frumin et al . investigated how humans behave after shaking hands with a stranger . Volunteers were asked to wait in a room alone before they were greeted by one of the researchers . Some of these volunteers were greeted with a handshake and others were greeted without a handshake . Afterwards , all the volunteers spent some time in a room by themselves where their behavior was covertly monitored . Frumin et al . found that volunteers who shook hands were more likely to sniff their hand , for example , by touching their nose when they were in the room on their own , than those who did not shake hands . After the volunteers shook hands with someone of their own gender , they spent more time sniffing their right hand ( the one they had used for the handshake ) . However , after the volunteers shook hands with someone of the opposite gender , they spent more time sniffing their left hand instead . Next , the body odor of some of the experimenters was tainted by perfumes or gender-specific odors . Volunteers who shook hands with these tainted individuals behaved differently; when the experimenter was tainted with perfume the volunteers spent more time sniffing their own hands , but when the experimenter was tainted with a gender-specific odor they spent less time sniffing of their own hands . This shows that different smells influenced the hand sniffing behavior of the volunteers . Frumin et al . 's findings suggest that a simple handshake may help us to detect chemical signals from other people . Depending on the person's gender , we may respond by sniffing our right hand to check out the person's odor , or our left hand to smell ourselves in comparison . Future studies will involve finding out how this sniffing behavior could work as an unconcious form of human communication ."," Handshaking is common among people, but scientists don't know why we do it. One theory is that we pick up smells from our partners and share those smells with others. To find out if this is true, the authors had people shake hands with someone else who smelled like them. They also had some people touch their nose without shaking hands. Then, they measured how many people touched their noses. If people shook hands, they would smell like the person they just shaked hands with. If they didn't shake hands, then they wouldn't smell like anyone else. The authors found that people did touch their noseless hand more after shaking hands compared to when they didn’t shake any hands. So, maybe people do shake hands to check out the smells of other people! Scientists think that people might even use handshake smells to figure out if they want to hang out with someone. That means that people should wash their hands before deciding if they like someone or not. The author thinks that people probably already do this, but he wants everyone to try it too see if it works. It turns out that men and women do shake differently, but the authors say that doesn’t mean anything. Men and women also act differently depending on who they are talking to. For example, men smile more when they talk to women instead of other men. Women also smile more at men than other women. The bottom line is that people need to keep shaking hands until scientists figure out exactly why we shake hands. People should also remember to wash their hand before deciding whether they like somebody or not! Finally, the author says that people shouldn’t feel weird about shaking hands because it’s normal to exchange smells. Just don’t forget to wash your hands afterwards! 1) What do you think? Is it good or bad to shake hands? Why? 2) Have you ever noticed that people smell different? How do you know that? Can you tell me how you knew that? 3) Did you ever notice that boys and girls behave differently? How? 4) Do you think it’ll be cool to shake someone’s hand and taste what they ate? Why or why not? 5) Should people always wash their mouths before kissing someone? Why yes or no?"
"Proteins , the molecules that make up the cells’ internal machinery , are responsible for almost every process that keeps cells alive . Watching how proteins move and interact within a living cell can help scientists to better understand these biological mechanisms . Single-particle tracking is a recent technique that makes these observations possible by taking ‘live’ recordings of individual proteins in a cell . Typically , the goal of a single-particle tracking experiment is to assign proteins into groups , or subpopulations , based on the way they move in the cell . For example , one subpopulation may be bound to other cellular structures , a second moving freely at a high speed , and a third diffusing slowly . This informs on the biological roles of the proteins . The method involves an experimental stage and an analysis stage . During the experiment , proteins of interest are labeled with a small dye molecule that produces light when excited by a laser . The laser then illuminates the cell , stimulating all the labels in a thin layer . The position of each molecule is then determined with a microscope and a ‘snapshot’ taken . By repeating this process over multiple images , the movement of each molecule over time can be tracked . However , experimental problems can make the interpretation difficult . Motion blurring takes place when the proteins move so fast they appear as blurs in the images; tracking errors happen when so many proteins are present in the same space their trajectories overlap . Here , Hansen , Woringer et al . combine two pre-existing methods to improve the experimental set-up . Using lasers that flash like a strobe light reduces motion blurring by essentially taking snapshots of the proteins at short time intervals . Tracking errors are addressed by a technique whereby only one protein at a time produces light . Once the images are obtained and analyzed to yield trajectories , the trajectories themselves need to be analyzed to determine the number and properties of the protein subpopulations . Several factors can skew this analysis stage . For example , there is often a bias against fast-moving particles because the laser only lights up a thin layer of the cell . The proteins travelling slowly stay in focus long enough to be detected across many images; the fast ones quickly move out of the layer and are therefore counted less often . Hansen , Woringer et al . designed a free and user-friendly algorithm package called Spot-On to correct for this issue . Spot-On was thoroughly benchmarked against other solutions , demonstrating both its accuracy and robustness . Single-particle tracking can lead to misleading results if used incorrectly . It is essential to publically share solutions that help make this technique more rigorous , especially since a growing number of scientists have already started to use the method ."," Scientists want to learn about what happens inside living things, like in the nucleus of a cell. They can watch tiny particles inside the nucleuses of live cells, but it is hard to figure out what is going on. It helps to take pictures quickly, like taking photos of cars driving down a street. But even cameras that shoot really fast cannot catch everything. So researchers came up with a clever idea to make sure they did not miss anything. They took lots of little movies of the particles and put them together to make one longer movie. Then they looked at the long movie to try to figure it out. They tried different ideas and picked the best one. They think this idea will help them learn about the particles better. They hope it will help doctors learn about diseases too. That is why this research is important. It shows that scientists can come up with good ideas to solve problems. And maybe someday they will learn enough about the tiny particles in the cells to help people who have sicknesses. That would be great! That is what this article is about. Researchers came up w with a neat idea to help them watch tiny things inside cells. They thought of a way that lets them look at the tiny things without missing any of them. Now they can try to learn more about what is happening inside cells and maybe help doctors find ways to fix health problems. They figured out their idea works pretty well. They checked by looking at tiny things in cells very carefully. They also checked by taking pictures of the tiny thing really quick and putting them together. They looked at these pictures and thought their idea worked well. Then, they tried their idea on another kind of cell. Again, their idea seemed to work well. This means their idea probably works for lots of kinds of cells. Their idea seems to let scientists watch tiny stuff inside cells without missing anything. That means they can start to learn what is actually happening inside the cells. Maybe they can learn how to fix things that are wrong in cells. That could help doctors treat people who get sick. That’s why this science is important!"
"Plants have an internal time keeper known as the circadian clock that operates in 24-hour cycles to coordinate the plants behaviors with the environment . The clock is made of many different proteins and plants carefully control when they make and destroy these proteins to regulate the cycle . Inside plant cells , enzymes known as E3 ubiquitin ligases determine which proteins are destroyed by labelling target proteins with a small tag . Plants have hundreds of different E3 ubiquitin ligases , leading to overlaps in the roles the different enzymes play . These overlaps make it difficult to identify the specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that are involved in a particular process . As a result , only few E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in the circadian clock have been identified so far . A small weed known as Arabidopsis is often used in research studies because it grows quickly and the genes can be easily manipulated . Here , Feke et al . set out to develop a new tool to identify the specific E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in regulating the circadian clock in Arabidopsis . The team created a library of hundreds of Arabidopsis plants producing different decoy E3 ubiquitin ligases that retained their ability to bind to target proteins but were unable to degrade them . Nearly a quarter of the E3 ligases found in Arabidopsis were represented in this library . The decoy enzymes protected the target proteins from being degraded by the normal E3 ubiquitin ligases , resulting in the library plants having presumably higher levels of these target proteins compared to normal Arabidopsis plants . By tracking circadian rhythms in these plants , the team was able to identify the individual E3 ligases that control the circadian clock . The experiments revealed several E3 ligases that may regulate the circadian clock , including two enzymes called MAC3A and MAC3B . Further experiments demonstrated that MAC3A and MAC3B have similar roles in regulating the circadian clock and can compensate for the absence of the other . The library of Arabidopsis plants generated by Feke et al . is now available for other researchers to use in their studies . In the future this approach could be adapted to make similar libraries for crops and other plants that have even more E3 ligase enzymes than Arabidopsis ."," Researchers wanted to learn more about how the body's natural ""clock"" keeps track of time. They knew that tiny pieces of chemicals called proteins helped move the clock along. Some of these proteons were thought to act like ""stop signs,"" telling the clock to slow down. Others seemed to tell the clock when to speed up. The researchers created a way to test if proteins might be stop signs. They put the new test into computer programs and looked at what happened inside them. When they changed just one piece of the program, the whole thing ran faster. That meant the proteons did indeed seem to be stoppers! Next, the scientists took a closer look at one particular protein called MAC3b. They saw that it slowed down the clock sometimes, but sped it up other times. Looking closely at another protein called PUB 48 gave them similar results. Finally, the team learned that another protein, PUB3, might also be a stopper. If all four proteins worked together, the clock would run normally. But if any one of them didn't work well enough, the ""stop"" wouldn't happen properly. That caused the clock's ticking to go too fast. So, the proteon MAC3a seems to be a kind of ""stop sign."" It tells the clock body to pause. Sometimes, though, it doesn't do that very well. Other proteons like PUBs help out, but don't quite get the timing right. Together, these proteoms help the body keep good time. The scientists hope learning more about these proteon stop signs will teach us how to fix problems with the body clock. That knowledge could let doctors figure out ways to treat people who have trouble keeping time. For instance, someone who works night shift might need medicine that makes their body clock run backwards again. Or maybe someone who travels a lot might take medicine that helps their body stay in one time zone instead of switching back and forth."
"It takes an army of immune cells to defend the body against infection . But sometimes the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells and chronic inflammatory conditions develop . In multiple sclerosis – also known as “MS” – a horde of immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord , forming lesions which strip nerve cells of their insultation , a protective fatty material called myelin . Nerve cells become damaged , scarred and exposed , and this interferes with messages between the brain and other parts of the body . Advanced imaging techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by capturing lesions as they develop in the brain and spinal cord . Researchers have also focused their efforts on understanding how immune cells activated in the blood stream invade the central nervous system . To better understand how a mistaken immune response leads to nerve damage in multiple sclerosis , a forensic examination of which immune cells accumulate in brain tissue to form lesions is needed . Standard techniques for analyzing whole tissue samples are however limited by design , capable of detecting only a few cell markers in one section of tissue . Ramaglia et al . have now validated a new imaging technique for looking at an array of cell types in brain tissue in a single sample . The technique – called imaging mass cytometry ( or IMC for short ) – was used to look at post-mortem brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient with an acute form of the illness . The tissue examined had multiple sclerosis lesions present . Different types of immune cells were simultaneously identified and characterized using a panel of antibodies which recognize the signature proteins each immune cell makes when active . The state of the underlying myelin content of the tissue was also characterized . The imaging approach could distinguish between the immune cells of the brain ( known as resident microglia ) and a type of white blood cell summoned as part of the immune response ( infiltrating macrophages ) . The analysis showed that , in the particular patient examined , microglia are abundant in active lesions in multiple sclerosis; also , different subsets of white blood cells were detected . Measuring how far different immune cells had migrated from nearby blood vessels added insights as to how immune cells move through the brain and which cells may have arrived first . Altogether , Ramaglia et al . have shown that IMC can be used as a discovery tool to gain a deeper understanding of multiple sclerosis lesions and immune cells active in the inflamed brain . Further work will apply this now validated imaging approach to large cohorts of multiple sclerosis patients ."," Researchers found a way to take pictures of tiny pieces of brain cells at the very same time. They took pictures of different parts of the brain where there were either healthy cells, or damaged cells. They looked at the different types and locations of cells, and figured out how the cells changed depending on where they were located in the patient’s brain. They also checked to see if the cells were changing in a regular pattern, or if they were changing randomly. They found that the cells in different places of the patient's brain were behaving differently. They think that this new way of taking pictures of brain tissues may help doctors find out more about how different parts and types of cells change during diseases like multiple s clerosis. They hope that this may eventually help doctors figure out better ways to treat people with these diseases. 1) What is the main topic? Mass cytometric imaging (also known as imaging flow cytometer) is a technique that allows researchers to simultaneously analyze the expression of 2–15 protein markers in tissue specimens. It combines traditional flow cystometry techniques with histopathology. 2) Who is affected by the condition being studied? Multiple scleros is a chronic autoimmune disorder affecting myelin sheaths around nerve axons in the central nervous system. It affects women more often than men. Symptoms vary widely and include fatigue, weakness, pain, numbness, vision problems, balance issues, and cognitive difficulties. There is currently no cure for multiple s cloerosis, but medications can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. 3) How is the condition diagnosed? Diagnosis of multiple sclosis requires a combination of clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. MRI is particularly useful because it shows characteristic patterns of white matter damage. 4) What part of the body is affected? Multipe sclerois affects myelin sheets surrounding nerve axon in the Central Nervous System. 5) Is there a treatment? Yes, there are several drugs approved for treating multiple sclosure. These include interferon beta, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, fingolimod, nataluzmab, and alemtuzumab."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( or COPD ) is a serious condition that causes the lungs to become inflamed for long periods of time , leading to permanent damage of the airways . Immune cells known as neutrophils promote inflammation after an injury , or during an infection , to aid the healing process . However , if they are active for too long , they may also cause tissue damage and drive inflammatory diseases including COPD . To limit damage to the body , neutrophils usually have a very short lifespan and die by a regulated process known as apoptosis . Finding ways to stimulate apoptosis in neutrophils may be key to developing better treatments for inflammatory diseases . Cells contain many enzymes known as kinases that control apoptosis and other cell processes . Drugs that inhibit specific kinases are effective treatments for some types of cancer and other conditions , and new kinase-inhibiting drugs are currently being developed . However , it remains unclear which kinases regulate apoptosis in neutrophils or which kinase-inhibiting drugs may have the potential to treat COPD and other inflammatory diseases . To address these questions , Rahman et al . tested over 350 kinase-inhibiting drugs to identify ones that promote apoptosis in neutrophils . The experiments showed that human neutrophils treated with drugs that inhibit the ErbB family of kinases died by apoptosis more quickly than untreated neutrophils . Next , Rahman et al . used zebrafish with injured tail fins as models to study inflammation . Zebrafish treated with one of these drugs – known as Tyrphostin AG825 – had lower levels of inflammation and their neutrophils underwent apoptosis more frequently than untreated zebrafish . Since drugs can have off-target effects , Rahman et al . went on to show using gene-editing technology that reducing the activity of two genes that encode ErbB kinases in zebrafish also decreased the levels of inflammation in the fish . Further experiments used mice that develop inflammation in the lungs similar to COPD in humans . As expected , neutrophils in the lungs of mice treated with Tyrphostin AG825 underwent apoptosis more frequently than those in untreated mice . These dead neutrophils were effectively cleared by other immune cells called macrophages , which also helps limit damage caused by neutrophils . Together , these findings show that Tyrphostin AG825 and other drugs that inhibit ErbB kinases help to reduce inflammation by promoting the death of neutrophils . Since several of these drugs are already used to treat human cancers , it may be possible in the future to repurpose them for use in people with COPD and other long-term inflammatory diseases . Determining whether this is possible is an aim for future studies ."," Scientists discovered that certain medicines that stop a type of protein called ""Erb"" from working can make neutrophi go away faster. They tested these medicines on special fish whose skin heals just like human skin. Then, they tried the medicine on people who have a breathing problem called ""COPD"". Finally, they gave the medicine to mice that got a breathing infection. All of these things helped get rid of the neutro phils faster! Now scientists know that these medicnes might be helpful for people with breathing problems like COPD. They plan to try giving these medicne s to people soon. It might even help them breathe better!...and live happily ever after!!!....................!!!!!!!!!!................................ ……………...,,,...,.,,...,,,,..,....,.,....,..!!......................... ................................,........,.....,.....,,,.,,.,...,....,....,..!..!..!.!.!!..!!..!!..!!!..!!!.!!!!.!!!!.!!.......!!!.!!!.!!.!.!.!.....!....!...!!....!!......!!!!..!!!!!.!!.!...,.!,.!!,...!.,....,.!....!...!....,. *****. *******. ***. *. ***. ******************. ***********. ************. **************. ***************. *. *. **. ***. ****. *****. ******. *******. **********. ****************. *****************.. *.. **.. **.. ***..****..***** ****. ~~~~~~~. ~~~~~~~~~~~. ~~~~~~~~~~~~. ~~~~~.. ~~.. ~~. ~~~. ~~ ~~. ----. ----. --------. ---------. ----------. -----------. ------------. ------------------. -------. ------. ---------. -------------."
"Much of what happens in biology occurs at scales so small that the microscopy methods traditionally used by biologists cannot visualize them . One such process is bacterial sporulation: in stressful conditions , bacteria like Bacillus subtilis can divide to produce a smaller cell called a forespore , which the larger mother cell then engulfs . The forespore matures into a hardy spore , which is able to survive in harsh environments and only transform into an active bacterium when conditions improve . Bacterial cells are surrounded by a stiff layer of a material called peptidoglycan . This wall sits outside of the bacterium’s thin flexible membrane and determines the bacterium’s shape . At the beginning of sporulation , the forespore is separated from the mother cell by a peptidoglycan wall . Engulfment of the spore by the mother cell requires a dramatic change in the shape of this partition . Microbiologists had thought that all the rigid peptidoglycan must be degraded to allow the partition to deform flexibly during engulfment; however , no one had yet observed the tiny structures involved . Khanna et al . directly visualized sporulation in B . subtilis using a technique called cryo-electron tomography ( or cryo-ET for short ) . In cryo-ET , samples are cooled to low temperatures and then imaged with a beam of electrons . Cryo-ET requires thin samples , thinner even than most bacteria . By combing cryo-ET with another methodology that allowed them to focus in on thin sections of their sample , Khanna et al . generated high resolution images , which provided a look at forespore engulfment in unprecedented detail . These images revealed that the peptidoglycan wall separating the mother cell from forespore is not completely degraded: a thin layer of peptidoglycan persists . Comparing these images to cryo-ET images of cells treated with drugs that block the production of peptidoglycan suggested a new engulfment mechanism . This includes a cycle of peptidoglycan production and degradation that accompanies the advancing mother cell membrane as it surrounds the forespore during engulfment . Khanna et al . could also see that the mother cell’s membrane formed finger-like projections as it moved around the forespore , something that was not visible with previous techniques . This detailed engulfment mechanism is an important advance in the understanding of bacterial spore formation . Additionally , Khanna et al . have generated a collection of images , methods and analyses that may prove useful to a wide community of biologists attempting to understand sporulation and other fundamental processes that occur on a small scale ."," Researchers used special equipment to look at bacteria called Bacilla subtills that live in groups called spores. When these bacteria decide to reproduce, half of them stay behind and start dividing into smaller pieces. As they divide, the bacteria push apart their outer shells, leaving a hole in the middle. Eventually, the remaining bacteria fill up the holes. The researchers saw that the bacteria leave a bit of their outer wall behind, so that the new piece of bacteria can grow bigger. Then, the rest of the bacteria surround the smaller ones and eat them. The scientists think that the leftover walls help guide the eating bacteria closer to the smaller pieces of bacteria. By studying how the bacteria move closer to each others, the researchers learned more about how bacteria communicate with each other and coordinate their actions. This finding could help doctors learn how to stop bacteria from causing diseases. It could also teach us more about things that happen in living cells that we don’t really understand yet. That would be good news! Because bacteria cause lots of diseases, learning more about them could help us figure out ways to fight them. Learning more about bacteria is also interesting because it lets us know more about life in general. Just like people and plants have different ways of communicating with each others and figuring out what to do next, so do bacteria. And just like we can learn something from watching people and talking to them, we can also learn a lot by looking at bacteria and trying to talk to them too! Of course, we don't mean that bacteria can hear us or feel what we feel. But we can try to guess what they are doing based on what happens when we mess with them. So, if we want to know more, we have to pay attention to what happens and keep asking questions. That way, maybe someday we'll get answers! And that would be awesome!"
"New treatments are tested in clinical trials before they are licensed for use in patients , but until the drugs are available for prescribing it’s not always possible to identify every side effect . When the drugs enter the clinic , they might be prescribed to patients with multiple medical conditions , or combined with other treatments . The drugs may also be taken for longer periods of time than tested in trials . It is therefore common for new adverse reactions to emerge after a drug is in widespread use . The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System ( FAERS ) is a surveillance system used in the United States for reporting drug side effects after new treatments have been licensed . Healthcare professionals and patients can submit reports to the database , logging the adverse drug reactions that they have experienced . FAERS currently contains over 8 . 5 million entries , and is growing all the time . However , Maciejewski et al . show that the database has several shortcomings that are reducing its usefulness . For instance , on average any given drug will have 16 different names in the system; this makes it challenging to group all of the reported side effects so that trends and patterns can be correctly seen . To address this first problem , Maciejewski et al . grouped together drugs according to their active ingredients , rather than their name . This made it much easier to account for subsequent , and more crucial conflating factors such as multiple reports for the same adverse event and patient , or cases where adverse reactions were confused with the diseases that the drugs are trying to treat . For example , diabetes was listed as a side effect for drugs used to treat diabetes . Building on this cleaned-up dataset , Maciejewski et al . monitored how adverse event signals evolve over time and uncovered biases that were hard to see otherwise . For example , side-effects were reported more often when drugs were in the news . More strikingly , this bias affected not only the drug in question , but also other drugs that acted in the same way or on the same molecular target . The computational method developed by Maciejewski et al . allows the data in FAERS to be combined and corrected , making easier to evaluate the safety of different medicines . The link between adverse side effects and the molecular targets of the drug , via the ingredient’s chemical structure , furthermore makes it possible to analyze such clinical data reliably by using chemical and genetic information . In the future , this method could also help to identify previously unknown side effects and the biological mechanisms behind them . This could help researchers to develop new drugs with improved side effect profiles ."," Every year, millions of people take medicines to treat illnesses. Sometimes, these treatments can lead to side effects, which can be serious. These side effects need to be monitored carefully, especially after a medicine is approved and starts being taken by many people. There are several ways to keep tabs on these side effects. One popular option is to ask doctors to fill out forms whenever a patient experiences a side effect. Unfortunately, these forms are not always filled out correctly, and sometimes doctors forget to send them in. Another option is for patients themselves to fill in forms describing any side effects they experience. However, this takes extra effort on the part of both doctor and patient, and so tends not to be reliable enough. As a result, there is currently no good way to properly collect information about side effects occurring in everyday medical practice. Ideally, doctors and patients would both fill in the forms, and doctors would remember to send the forms in. However, this does not happen in real life. Therefore, there needs to be a better way to collect information on side effects. One solution is to use computers to analyze information from something called the Food and Drugs Administration Advers Events Reporting Systems (FAERS). This computer program contains information from lots of different sources, like doctors' offices and hospitals. By looking at this kind of information, scientists can learn about the side effects of different medications. They can also see how often these side effect happen, and how bad they usually are. This helps them decide whether or not to prescribe a medication to a patient. In addition, comparing the side effect lists of different drugs can give clues about why some side effects happen. For instance, if two drugs share similar side effect profiles, it means that they probably act in a similar way inside the body. On the other hand, if the side-effect profiles of two drugs are completely different, it indicates that they work in totally different ways. Overall, studying the side affects of different medicines can help us understand how they work, and guide decisions about whether or"
"The human brain is ever changing , constantly rewiring itself in response to new experiences , knowledge or information from the environment . Addictive drugs such as cocaine can hijack the genetic mechanisms responsible for this plasticity , creating dangerous , obsessive drug-seeking and consuming behaviors . Cocaine-induced plasticity is difficult to apprehend , however , as brain regions or even cell populations can react differently to the compound . For instance , sub-regions in the striatum – the brain area that responds to rewards and helps to plan movement – show distinct responses during progressive exposure to cocaine . And while researchers know that the drug immediately changes how neurons switch certain genes on and off , it is still unclear how these genetic modifications later affect behavior . Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . explored these questions at different scales , first focusing on how progressive cocaine exposure changed the way various gene programs were activated across the entire brain . This revealed that programs in the striatum were the most affected by the drug . Examining this region more closely showed that cocaine switches on genes in specific ‘spiny projection’ neuron populations , depending on where these cells are located and the drug history of the mouse . Finally , Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . used genetically modified mice to piece together cocaine exposure , genetic changes and modifications in behavior . These experiments revealed that the drive to seek cocaine depended on activation of the Egr2 gene in populations of spiny projection neurons in a specific sub-region of the striatum . The gene , which codes for a protein that regulates how genes are switched on and off , was itself strongly activated by cocaine intake . Cocaine addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals . Grasping how this drug alters the brain could pave the way for new treatments , while also providing information on the basic mechanisms underlying brain plasticity ."," Drug abuse causes long-term changes in the way certain parts of the ""reward center"" of the mouse's brain work. Researchers looked at how the brain responds to drugs using special methods that let them look at how some genes work. They saw that some genes changed how they worked in different ways depending on where in the reward center the researchers looked. When they blocked off one kind of gene from working in one part of this center, mice stopped liking being around the place where they got the drug. This shows that the way these genes work in this part of brain is important for making mice want to go to places where they took drugs. Further studies will need to figure out exactly why these genes are needed here and how they make mice seek out places where drugs are available. This could help us understand why people keep taking drugs despite problems caused by abuse. It could also help us find ways to stop cravings for drugs. This study gives us tools to explore how the way genes work changes in different areas of the part of mouse brain that handles rewards. This should help us learn more about how the reward centers of the brains of mices and humans work. That could teach us more about why people take drugs even though it harms them. It might also help doctors find treatments for addictions. This article describes how the brains and minds of living creatures work. It explains how things happen inside the heads of micses so that we can understand why they behave the way they do. It also tells us how we can use what we know about how mice behave to help us deal with problems that happen in people's lives. This means that science can help us solve problems! That is really cool! Science is awesome! Let's keep doing it! Cool stuff! Neat! Awesome! Rad! Sweet! Rockin'! Groovy!"
"Neurons transmit information using electrical activity . Whereas electrical currents in wires consist of moving electrons , those in neurons are made up of charged particles called ions . These flow into and out of the cells through specialized channels in the outer membrane . Changes in ion channels can disrupt brain activity . However , unravelling the interactions between molecules that give rise to particular behaviours or diseases is challenging in living animals . Computer models can simplify this task , but only if the models are accurate copies of living systems . It is never possible to obtain a completely accurate model , so instead the goal is to make sure that any understanding derived from the models can guide new experiments , and that models are refined appropriately based on the results of these new experiments . Sekulić and Skinner used computer modelling to explore how ion channels affect the properties of a type of neuron called the oriens lacunosum/moleculare ( O-LM ) cell . These are found in a region of the brain called the hippocampus , which is involved in learning and memory . When animals explore their environment , the O-LM cells fire in synchrony with other cells in the hippocampus . Hippocampal cell populations typically fire either between 4 and 7 times per second , known as low theta , or 7 to 12 times per second , called high theta . Low theta firing supports the processing of emotions , whereas high theta helps animals form a mental map of their surroundings . Sekulić and Skinner wanted to know how the distribution of ion channels in O-LM cells – particularly a subtype called h-channels – affects whether the cells take part in theta firing . The task was made possible by the availability of a database of computer models of O-LM cells , each featuring a different distribution of ion channels . Sekulić and Skinner exposed each model to patterns of activity simulating those in the brain of an animal exploring its environment . The results revealed that specific combinations and distributions of ion channels predispose , or “tune” , O-LM cells to participate in either low or high theta , and thus emotional or spatial learning in the hippocampus . The next step is to test the predictions of the models experimentally . Studies should examine whether the distribution of ion channels in O-LM cells does indeed predispose them to fire at particular frequencies , as the models suggest . A further question is how targeting O-LM cells in freely moving animals would affect spatial and emotional memory ."," Researchers built computer programs to mimic the behavior of special cells in a part of the mouse's brain called the hippo campus. They then changed the settings of the program to match what happens in real life. By doing so, they discovered that the computer programs behaved differently depending on how the cells were being influenced by other nearby cells. Specifically, the computer program acted differently depending upon whether certain proteins were present or absent in the cells. This suggests that the proteins might play a role in determining how the brain cells behave. Future researchers could use this knowledge to design drugs that target the proteINS and treat diseases that involve problems with the hippop campus. This study shows how scientists can take what they know about how cells work and apply it to make predictions about how the whole system works. It also shows how studying computer programs can give us insights into how living systems work. Finally, it shows how looking closely at proteins in cells can tell us something about how those cells act. Overall, this study advances our understanding of how the hipppopampus works and how to possibly treat diseases involving problems with that area of the body. It is exciting to think that this kind of research could lead to treatments for illnesses affecting the brain! Scientists hope to continue exploring how the proteINs in cells work, and how they relate to how the body functions overall. Studying how the computer versions of cells behave could help guide future research into how the real cells behave too. Ultimately, this could help doctors come up with ways to fix problems in the brain. That would be amazing! Who knows what else we'll discover along the way? Only time will tell! One thing for sure though, is that computers are really helpful tools for helping us understand how things work. And that's pretty cool! Science is awesome! Yay! Science! Woohoo!!!"
"Bacteria and viruses have long been fighting amongst themselves . Bacteriophages are a type of virus that invade bacteria; their name literally means ‘bacteria eater’ . The bacteriophage T7 , for example , infects the common bacteria known as Escherichia coli . Once inside , the virus hijacks the bacterium’s cellular machinery , using it to replicate its own genetic material and make more copies of the virus so it can spread . At the same time , the bacteria have found ways to try and defend themselves , which in turn has led some bacteriophages to develop countermeasures to overcome those defences . Many bacteria , for example , have restriction enzymes which recognise certain sections of the bacteriophage DNA and cut it into fragments . However , the T7 bacteriophage has one well-known protein called Ocr which inhibits restriction enzymes . Ocr does this by mimicking DNA , which led Ye et al . to wonder if it could also interrupt other vital processes in a bacterial cell that involve DNA . Transcription is the first step in a coordinated process that turns the genetic information stored in a cell’s DNA into useful proteins . An enzyme called RNA polymerase decodes the DNA sequence into a go-between molecule called messenger RNA , and it was here that Ye et al . thought Ocr might jump in to interfere . To begin , Ye et al . examined the structure of Ocr when it binds to RNA polymerase using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy . Ocr has been well-studied before , its structure previously described , but not when attached to RNA polymerase . The analysis showed that Ocr gets in the way of specific molecules , called sigma factors , that show RNA polymerase where to start transcription . Ocr binds to RNA polymerase in exactly the same pocket as part of sigma factors do , which is also the place where DNA must be to be decoded to make messenger RNA . Ye et al . then performed experiments to show Ocr interfering with binding to RNA polymerase did indeed disrupt transcription . This means Ocr is quite versatile as it interferes with the RNA polymerase of the bacterial host and its restriction enzymes . Ocr’s strategy of mimicking DNA to interrupt transcription could be adopted as an approach to develop new antibiotics to stop bacterial infections . DNA transcription is an essential cellular process – without it , no cell can replicate and survive – and RNA polymerase is already a validated target for drugs . Following Ocr’s lead could provide a new way to stop infections , if the right drug can be designed to fit ."," Researchers studied a protein called Ocr that helps bacteria fight against viruses. They learned about the structure of OCR and how it works inside the bacteria. Specifically, they discovered that OCR stops the bacteria from making copies of their genes. They did this by learning how OCR fits into a machine that makes copies of genes, called ""RNA Polymerase"", and blocking it so that no copying happens. This finding gives scientists ideas for creating new kinds of medicines that stop bacteria from causing infections. It also teaches us more about how bacteria protect themselves from viruses that want to harm them. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into biological mechanisms and medical treatments. It is significant because it identifies a new way that bacteria defend themselves from harmful viruses and explains how this defense works. This discovery could lead to better treatments for bacterial infections caused by various types of bacteria. Further investigation into the relationship between Ocr and RNA Poly merase may yield additional insights into the functions of both components and inform the development of improved therapeutic approaches. Additionally, studying the interactions between OCR, RNA Pol, and other related proteins could deepen our comprehension of gene regulation and infection resistance in bacteria. Finally, exploring the connections between OCRE and other antiviral defenses in bacteria might offer fresh perspectives on combatting viral illnesses. By doing so, we can gain a broader perspective on the diversity of defensive tactics employed by bacteria and apply this knowledge to enhance existing antibacterial therapies. Furthermore, investigating the association between Ocre and other protective mechanisms utilized by bacteria against viral assaults might give fresh viewpoints on fighting viral sicknesses. Doing so would widen our grasp of the variety of safeguarding techniques deployed by prokaryotes and enable us to improve current antibacterials. Thus, this study offers crucial information regarding the molecular foundation of bacterial immunity against virulent phages and presents prospective targets for developing innovative medications aimed at thwarting bacterial disease transmission."
"Nearly all animals sleep more while they are still developing , suggesting that sleep is important in early life . Previous studies have shown that sleep may be required for building connections in the brain . However , it has been difficult to study the effects of sleep in earlier stages of brain development , when stem cells divide to create brain cells in a process known as “neurogenesis” . This is partly because , in mammals , most neurogenesis occurs in the womb . Scientists have successfully studied sleep using the common fruit fly . But these studies have so far focused on adult flies , in which neurogenesis is mostly complete . Fly larvae , on the other hand , are widely used to study brain development and neurogenesis . Compared to mammals in the womb , fruit fly larvae are very easy to access and manipulate . However , unlike adult flies , no one had previously looked to see if larvae even display a behaviour that would fit the definition of sleep . To see if fruit fly larvae do sleep , Szuperak et al . created the “LarvaLodge” , an apparatus in which individual larvae can be housed while having their activity monitored over time . In these lodges , a bright light was used to test how hard it is to arouse inactive fruit fly larvae , and further experiments asked what happens when larvae are prevented from resting . Then , to look at neurogenesis in the larvae , Szuperak et al . used a stain that labels dividing stem cells within the nervous system . Those cells could then be seen and counted when a larva was dissected and examined under a microscope . The results from the LarvaLodge showed that fruit fly larvae do indeed sleep: they have extended periods of rest during which they react less to outside disturbances and adopt a particular posture ( they retract their heads towards their bodies ) . Also when larvae were deprived of sleep , by shining a light or shaking , they compensated by sleeping more afterwards . Importantly , depriving the larvae of sleep also led to lower levels of neurogenesis . These findings establish the fruit fly larva as a new and useful system for studying the role of sleep in early development , and may help shed light on the role sleep plays in disorders affecting brain development ."," Sleep is important for our bodies to function well, even when we are young. During sleep, our brains make connections that help us learn and remember things. It is therefore very important that babies and children get enough sleep every day. New research shows that even baby flies need to sleep! Just like humans, baby flies sleep less when they are learning to walk. But if baby flies don’t sleep enough, they have trouble remembering where they should go. Like humans, flies use special hormones called “neurotransmitters” to tell their brains what to do. Some neurotransmittiers make us feel alert, and some make us tired. Researchers wanted to know which kind makes baby flies feel alert. They knew that one type, called “octapamine”, makes adult flies feel awake. So, they gave baby flies drugs that either increase or decrease levels of octapamine. Then, they watched how much the baby flies slept. They also watched how well the baby fly brains worked when they didn’t get enough rest. The researchers found that octapmine doesn’t make baby flies want to stay awake. Another chemical, called tyramine, did make the baby fl ys want to wake up. And, just like humans who don’ t get enough s leep, baby fl ys that didn’ t have enough tyraminer had trouble learning where to go. This means that tyramin is probably the chemical that tells baby flies when it’s time to wake u p and explore their world. This discovery will help scientists learn more about why we all need to s leeps, even as babies. It will also help doctors figure out how to give babies the right amount of sleep they need to grow big and strong. That way, everyone can enjoy a healthy, happy life! 😴🐥👶‍💤"
"We communicate with each other using speech , writing and physical gestures . But how do bacteria , yeast and other single-celled microbes communicate ? In 2014 , researchers reported a new example of communication between bacteria and yeast in which the bacteria send a chemical message that has a very long-lasting effect on how the yeast grow in certain environments . This in turn also affected the ability of the bacteria to survive in these environments . The identity of the chemical message produced by the bacteria , however , was not known . Garcia , Dietrich et al . – including one of the researchers from the previous study – used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the chemical message . The experiments show that the message is a molecule called lactic acid , which is very common in nature and is produced by many bacteria . Garcia , Dietrich et al . found out how much lactic acid is needed to alter the growth of brewer’s yeast , and which genes in yeast are involved in responding to the message from the bacteria . Further experiments suggest that the ability of yeast and bacteria to communicate using lactic acid is likely to have existed for hundreds of millions of years . The next step following this work will be to identify other chemical messages used by microbes . The human body is packed with billions of bacterial cells , and in some cases yeast can also take up residence . A future challenge will be to find out if bacteria and yeast inside the human body are able to communicate with each other in ways that could affect our health ."," Prions are special types of proteins that cause changes in cell behaviour. They can spread from cell to cell by copying themselves. Some scientists discovered that certain bacteria can make yeasts behave differently by causing them to switch on a type of prion called [Gar+]. It turns out that this happens because the bacteria secrete a substance called lactic acer. The authors wanted to know how lactic aid worked, so they studied it in detail. They found that the lactic id helped the yeasts to overcome something called “glucose” repression”. This means that the yeast stopped being controlled by something that normally stops them from breaking down sugars. By studying the effects of lactaid on yeasts from different kinds of yeasts, the authors found that lactic ic helps to trigger [GAr+] in many different types of yeast. This shows that lactacid can help yeasts break free from the normal controls that tell them what to eat. Finally, the researchers discuss how other things besides lactic ice might also help yeast to break free of these controls in different environments. Overall, the study shows that yeasts can get help from bacteria by triggering a kind of prions that lets them break free form the usual controls on what they eat. This could happen in places where there are lots of different kinds or yeasts and bacteria. It will be interesting to see if other things can also help the yeats to break these controls. If so, this could mean that there are many ways for yeasts living in different places to adapt to their environment. This adaptation could let them survive even though there are a lot of different types or yeast and bacteria living together. This might explain why there are so many different kinds yeast living in so many places. It could also help us learn how to use yeasts better for things like making beer or medicines."
"A DNA double helix is made up of two DNA strands , which in turn are made of molecules that are each known by a single letter—A , T , C , or G . The sequence of these ‘letters’ in each DNA strand contains biological information . Genes are sections of DNA that can be ‘expressed’ to produce proteins and RNA molecules . To express a gene , the DNA strands in the double helix must first be partially separated so that one of them can be used as a template to build an RNA molecule in a process called transcription . Either of the DNA strands in a helix can be used as an RNA template , but contain different genes and are read in opposite directions . One of the two strands is called the ‘sense’ strand , the other the ‘antisense’ strand . The RNA molecule does not transcribe a whole DNA strand; instead , it transcribes a section of DNA , known as a transcription unit , which contains at least one gene . The end of a transcription unit is marked by certain signals that stop transcription . However , some transcription units in a DNA strand overlap , so there must be some way that the transcription machinery can sometimes ignore these stop signals . The activity of some genes is linked to the activity of their immediate neighbours . Furthermore , some genes are expressed in different amounts in response to changes in environmental conditions . Researchers have previously suggested that there must be some form of switch that controls when these genes are expressed . Nguyen et al . now engineer start and stop signals at a neighbouring pair of genes , called HMS2 and BAT2 , in yeast . When one gene is switched on , the other is switched off and which gene is active depends on the diet of the yeast cells . On the antisense DNA strand opposite to HMS2 is another gene , SUT650 . Nguyen et al . show that when this gene is transcribed , the transcription of HMS2 on the other DNA strand is blocked . This has the knock-on effect of turning on BAT2 . Conversely , transcribing HMS2 switches off SUT650 and BAT2 because the end of HMS2 overlaps with the beginning of both SUT650 and BAT2 . Switching between different genes relies on loops that physically link the start and stop signals of the gene to be transcribed while ignoring the start and stop signals for neighbouring genes . Proteins called transcription factors can bind to DNA and affect whether a gene is transcribed . Nguyen et al . found that a transcription factor that binds near the start of the HMS2 gene helps to control which DNA strand is transcribed . When transcription factors do not bind to the start of HMS2 , antisense transcription—and the expression of SUT650—occurs instead . Overall , Nguyen et al . show that the transcription process itself makes up part of a switch that can control the expression of several genes on both the sense and antisense strands of a DNA double helix . This may also explain how many other , more complex , gene networks are activated in response to changes in the environment ."," Scientists discovered that there are many genes located close to each other on the DNA strand in yeasts. Some of these genes are turned on at different times depending on what food the yeasts eat. It seems like this happens because the genes are being affected by something else nearby on the strand. To figure out why this happens, the team looked at how the genes' ""food"" or energy comes from things nearby on their strand, and how those things affect the genes. They did this by looking at how much energy the genes take in compared to how much the things around them take in. They saw that sometimes the genes took in less energy than the things nearby, and sometimes they took in more. This seemed to happen because of how the things on the gene strand were positioned relative to each others' positions. Sometimes the things were lined up nicely with each others, and this let the genes get more energy. Other times, though, the things weren't lined up well, and that stopped the genes from getting energy. So, it looks like the things that are nearby on a gene strands can help or hinder the genes, and it all has to do with how the nearby things line up with eachother. Because of this, the genes seem to turn on at slightly different times. The team thinks that this is really cool because it helps us understand how things work in yeast. They think that maybe this also happens in people too! And since we don't know exactly how this works yet, they want to keep studying it to try to figure out even more details about how it works. That way, we can eventually use this knowledge to help treat illnesses or improve medicine. Hopefully, this will help doctors and patients live happier lives! Science is awesome! Yay science!!! :D.

"How we perceive what we see depends on the context in which we see it , such as what we are doing at the time . For example , we perceive a park landscape differently when we are running through it than when we are sitting on a park bench . Behavior can also alter neuronal responses in the brain . Indeed , the neurons in the part of the brain that receives information related to vision ( known as the visual cortex ) respond differently to visual stimuli when an animal is moving compared to when the animal is still . However , while some recent studies revealed that specific types of neurons become more or less responsive during movement , others reported the opposite results . One hypothesis that would explain these contradictory findings would be if the way that behavior , in this case movement , affects neuronal responses also depends on the external context in which the movement happens . Now , Pakan et al . have tested this hypothesis by imaging the activity of different types of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice that were either running on a treadmill or staying still . The experiments were conducted in two different contexts: in total darkness ( in which the mice could not see ) and in the presence of display screens ( which provided the mice with visual stimulation ) . Pakan et al . confirmed that running does indeed affect the activity of specific neurons in different ways in different contexts . For example , when the mice received visual stimulation , the three main classes of neurons that send inhibitory signals in the visual cortex became more active during running . However , when the mouse ran in the dark , two of these neuron types became more active during running while the third type of neuron was unresponsive . This finding reveals more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity that strongly depends on the animal’s behaviour . It also shows how these neurons influence the excitatory neurons in the visual cortex , which send information to the rest of the brain for further processing towards perception . The next step will be to identify what precise mechanism makes these neurons respond differently in unique contexts , and to tease apart how these movement-dependent signals affect the way animals perceive visual stimuli ."," Researchers wanted to know why the brains of mice react differently depending on whether they are moving around or sitting still. They discovered that different types of neurons behave very differently. Some neurons become more active when the mouse moves around, whereas others become less active. Surprisingly, some neurons became more active in darkness, and others became less active in bright light. All of these differences depended on the kind of neuron. The researchers conclude that there are multiple ways in which the brain can change how neurons react to movement. Understanding these differences will help scientists learn how the mouse brain controls movements. This knowledge should also help scientists better understand how the human brain works. For instance, understanding how the part of the human body that thinks responds to movement could help doctors find better ways to treat Parkinson’s disease. People with Parkinson's disease often shake because their thinking part of their brain cannot send messages to their bodies very quickly. That makes it hard for them to move smoothly. Knowing how the thinking part responds differently depending upon whether you are standing still or moving around could help scientists figure out better ways of fixing that problem. This research was done in mouses, so it won't immediately tell us anything about humans. Still, studying mices gives scientists ideas about how the brains in all mammals work. So, although this research didn't focus on humans, it still tells us something about how our brains work. And that means it is worth sharing! Note: The word ""neuron"" refers to a specialized type of cell that transmits signals throughout the brain. There are many kinds of neurones, and they differ in how they transmit signals. The article describes four different kinds of these special cells. The authors want to know how these different kinds act when the animal is moving around versus when it is sitting still, and how they act in darkness compared to when there is light."
"Putting on a necklace requires using your fingertips to hold open a clasp , which you then insert into a small ring . For you to do this , your nervous system must first work out which way the clasp and the ring are facing relative to one another . It then uses that information to coordinate the movements of your fingertips . If you fasten the necklace behind your head , your nervous system must perform these tasks without information from your eyes . Instead , it must use the way in which the edges of the clasp and the ring indent the skin on your fingertips to work out their orientation . Earlier studies have examined this process by asking healthy volunteers to judge the orientation of objects – or more precisely edges – that an experimenter has pressed against their fingertips . But people perform worse than expected on this task given their manual dexterity . Pruszynski et al . wondered whether the task might underestimate the abilities of the volunteers because it involves passively perceiving objects , rather than actively manipulating them . To test this idea , Pruszynski et al . designed a new experiment . Healthy volunteers were asked to use a fingertip to rotate a pointer on a dial to a target location . The participants could not see the dial , and so they had to use touch alone to determine which way the pointer was facing . They performed the task faster and more accurately than volunteers in the earlier passive experiments . Indeed , when the pointer was longer than a fingertip , the volunteers performed almost as well using touch alone as when allowed to look at the dial . Speed and accuracy remained impressive even when the pointer was only 2mm long . The results of Pruszynski et al . show that we judge orientation more accurately when we manipulate objects than when we passively perceive them . In other words , we do better when we perform tasks in which being aware of orientation is vital . The results also suggest that the nervous system processes sensory information in different ways when it uses sensations to help control objects as opposed to just perceiving them . This could influence the development of new technology that aims to use brain activity to control computers or robotic limbs ."," When you touch something, your fingers feel bumps and grooves. How sensitive are your fingers? Can you tell if two things are the same or slightly different? Researchers wanted to find out how good people are at telling if an object's edge is tilted ever so slightly. They asked participants to touch an object and rotate it until they felt that the object was horizontal again. Then they tried to figure out how well the participant could judge the angle of the object' s edge. It turned out that people could do this really well! Even when the object had an edge that was just 2mm wide, people still did pretty well judging the angle. So, our sense of touch is much more precise than we thought! And this means that we can manipulate tiny objects really well too. That's why when you pick up a pen, you don't drop it. Your hand guides the pen perfectly so that you can hold it steady. Just like a robot arm! Scientists think that humans might be able to improve robots so that they can handle little objects better too. Robots would need super sensitive hands that could feel the shape of things. Humans might even be able teach robots how to grab things and move them around. That way, robots could help us do lots of cool stuff that we normally couldn't do. Like play with Legos or build awesome sandcastles at the beach! Or maybe robots will learn to do things that we wouldn't want to do ourselves, like clean the gutters outside our houses. Yuck! Science is fun! And it helps us learn new things about ourselves and the world we live in. Who knows what else we'll discover? Maybe one day we' ll all become superheroes with special powers! We'll be able run really fast, jump really high, or lift really heavy things! Or perhaps we'l learn how to talk to animals or turn invisible! The possibilities are endless!"
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( or ALS ) is a disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord , such that more and more of these cells die as the disease progresses . Since nerve cells direct muscle movement , people with ALS increasingly lose control of their muscles , and may therefore lose the ability to speak , eat , move , and breathe . Around one in five people who have an inherited form of ALS also have mutations in a gene that encodes an enzyme called SOD1 . This antioxidant enzyme detoxifies harmful chemicals that are the byproducts of normal cellular activity . The mature active form of this enzyme contains two SOD1 proteins , each of which binds one copper ion and one zinc ion . Each protein in a pair also contains a strong bond that helps to stabilize its three-dimensional structure . However , immature copies of this protein , which lack the strong bond and metal ions , often fold into the wrong shape . These misfolded proteins can clump together into clusters , and potentially lead to the development of ALS . Efforts to study misfolded proteins are limited by the fact that misfolding is a rare event . As a result , protein samples generally contain very small fractions of misfolded molecules and most techniques for investigating protein structure are ill-suited to probe the process of misfolding . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( or NMR for short ) is one technique that has been used to visualize flexible proteins , and protein folding and misfolding , down to the level of individual atoms . Recent improvements in NMR spectroscopy have opened up the possibility of studying protein structures that exist at levels as low as 1% of the sample . Now , Sekhar et al . have used NMR to document the dynamics of immature SOD1 proteins . The experiments show that the protein is flexible and readily switches back and forth between its ‘default’ shape and one of at least four different shapes; and at any one time , the fraction of molecules in solution that were in each of these shapes was around 1% . Two of the shapes have many of the same features as those in a mature SOD1 protein pair . But the other two shapes involve SOD1 proteins interacting in unusual ways , and may resemble the cluster-forming misfolded SOD1 proteins . By using the NMR data to create three-dimensional models of the SOD1 proteins , Sekhar et al . were able to identify two sites on immature SOD1 proteins involved in these unusual interactions that are inaccessible in mature enzymatically active SOD1 . These findings suggest that targeting these two sites with drugs could possibly block the formation of toxic versions of SOD1 early in the course of ALS , and thus prevent the progression of the disease ."," Amyotrohpic Lateral Sclerose (ALS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. One type of ALS involves mutations in a protein named Superoxide Dismutase 1 or SOD 1. Previous studies have shown that SOD-1 can exist in multiple shapes or conformations. Some of these shapes are toxic to cells and might contribute to causing ALS. In this article, scientists used a technique called Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) to learn more about the different conformations that Sod-1 goes through. They discovered that there are actually four different conformational states that SCD-1 adopts. Three of these states involve the protein taking on a shape that is similar to what it needs to be in order to perform its normal biological functions. But one of these conformation states causes SOD to take on a harmful shape. Knowing more about how SOD can go from one shape to another might help scientists understand how to prevent the toxic shape from forming. This knowledge could eventually help doctors come up with better ways to treat patients with ALS caused by problems with SOD. For example, knowing more about SOD’s different conformatory states could help doctors figure out new drugs that stop SOD from going from its normal harmless shape to its toxic shape. Or maybe doctors could find ways to keep SOD in a shape where it can carry out its normal job without turning into the harmful shape that causes ALS symptoms. That would be really helpful! Doctors currently don’t know enough about SCD’s shapes to come up treatments that work very well. So, this study helps us learn more things that might help us fight ALS someday. That’s pretty cool! And it shows us how science works too – scientists did a bunch of experiments and figured out stuff that we didn’t really know before. That takes patience and hard work and is really neat!"
"A hormone called insulin finely controls the amount of sugar in the blood . When the blood sugar content is high , a group of cells in the pancreas release insulin; when it is low , they stop . In these cells , the level of sugar in the blood modifies the ratio of two molecules: ATP , the body’s energy currency , and ADP , a molecule closely related to ATP . Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio are therefore a proxy of the variations in blood sugar levels . In these pancreatic cells , a membrane protein called ATP sensitive potassium channel , KATP channel for short , acts as a switch that turns on and off the production of insulin . ATP and ADP control that switch , with the two molecules having opposite effects on the channel – ATP deactivates it , ADP activates it . The changes in ATP/ADP ratio – and by extension in blood sugar levels – are therefore coupled with the release of insulin . However , how KATP channels sense the changes in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells is still unclear . In particular , ATP levels are usually high and constant: ATP is then continuously deactivating the channels , and it is unclear how ADP ever activates them . Here , Lee et al . use a microscopy technique that can image biological molecules at the atomic scale to look at the structure of human pancreatic KATP channels . The 3D reconstruction maps show that KATP channels have binding sites for ATP but also one for ADP . This ADP site acts as a sensor that can detect even small changes in ADP levels in the cell . The maps also reveal a dynamic lasso-like structure connecting the ATP and ADP binding areas . This domain may play a vital role in allowing ADP to override ATP’s control of the channel . The presence of the ADP sensor and the lasso structure could explain how KATP channels monitor changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and can therefore control the release of insulin based on blood sugar levels . Defects in the KATP channels of the pancreas are present in genetic diseases where infants produce too much or too little insulin . Understanding the structure of these channels and how they work may help scientists to design new drugs to treat these conditions ."," Researchers have studied a type of protein called KATPs, which control the amount of potassium moving across certain types of cells. Previous studies showed that adding a chemical compound called ATP to these cells caused less potassum to move across the cell, whereas adding a different chemical compound, ADP, caused more potassm to move. The exact mechanism behind why ATP causes less movement and ADT causes more movement wasn't completely clear. Using special tools, the researchers were able to take images of the KATPS and see what chemicals were attached to them. By looking closely at these images, the team was able to propose a possible explanation for how ATP might cause less potasium to move and ADX might cause more to move, based on the position of different pieces of the overall KATPP structure. This proposal will need further testing to confirm it. But if confirmed, it would offer a better understanding of how these KATHP channels work. This knowledge could potentially lead to ways to improve health conditions affected by the proper movement of potasum across cells. For example, heart rhythm problems may occur when there isn't enough potassiu crossing through cells. Being able to control the movement of this mineral could help treat such problems. Other areas of research could also benefit from a better understading of how KATPH channels work, including cancer treatment and diabetes care. Understanding how these channels work could help doctors develop drugs that could help patients whose bodies don't regulate potassuum levels correctly. Such drugs could help reduce the risk of serious health issues, like sudden cardiac death. Or they could help lower blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes. While much more research needs to be done, this study offers a promising step forward in learning more about how these proteins work. And that knowledge could eventually lead to treatments for a variety of health problems."
"Over a billion people worldwide are infected , often for life , by a parasite known as Toxoplasma gondii . Most of the time , the parasites remain in a dormant state and cause no symptoms . However , the parasites can reactivate , which can be fatal for people with weaker immune systems . Currently no drugs can kill the dormant stages of T . gondii . One of the possible reasons T . gondii is so widespread is because it easily passes from host to host , and resists both detection and treatment . Like many parasites , T . gondii infects multiple hosts during its life cycle: it reproduces sexually in its ‘definitive' host , the cat , and reproduces asexually in its ‘intermediate’ hosts , which include virtually all warm-blooded animals . Unlike most parasites , all hosts can transmit T . gondii to other hosts , making it a very flexible parasite . However , its closest living relative , Hammondia hammondi , can only be transmitted from a definitive host to an intermediate host , or vice versa . The reason for this difference remains unclear , but comparisons between these species can hopefully help uncover how T . gondii came to be such a promiscuous parasite . Now , Sokol , Primack et al . report that a dramatic difference between H . hammondi and T . gondii is the ability to adapt to changes in the environment . While H . hammondi grows in a very strict and inflexible way , T . gondii can sense its environment and change its growth rate accordingly . This is important because it would allow T . gondii to grow until the host immune response is activated , at which time T . gondii can then quickly become dormant and hide from these host defences . Sokol , Primack et al . suggest that this unique adaptation may have helped T . gondii to become the globally successful parasite that it is today , and explain why H . hammondi is much less lethal . It is also possible that T . gondii reactivates after periods of dormancy because it senses changes in its environment . If so , and if scientists can identify the sensors required for this , it may also be possible to target them and effectively block reactivation in infected humans . Comparing T . gondii with H . hammondi may provide a good way to identify these sensors ."," Researchers wanted to learn more about how a certain kind of parasite called Hammondi hammongdi survives in different environments. They discovered that unlike another related parasite, Toxplasma gondi, Hammonda hammoundi cannot change its shape or size depending on what environment it lives in. Instead, it grows normally no matter what. Because of this, researchers think that Hammonds hammundi is better suited to live in different kinds of hosts because it doesn’t need to change its appearance to fit in. They also learned that Hammodia hhammongdi is sensitive to things that cause stress, like changes in pH or temperature, which makes them less likely to turn into cysts. Finally, they created a special version of Hammonia hhmmdi that glows red so people can easily see it under a microscope. This will help scientists study it more easily and figure out exactly why it is so good at living in lots of different places. Overall, the researchers think this information helps explain why Hammond hammondoni is able to live inside many different types of animals, including humans. Understanding this could help doctors come up with new ways to treat diseases caused by parasites like Hammond hammdoni. It could also teach us how to make medicines that stop parasites from changing shapes or sizes, which would make them harder to get rid of. That way, we wouldn’t get sick from them anymore. And finally, learning more about these kinds of parasites could help us understand how they became so good and surviving in so many different places, which could lead to new ideas about how life works. That would be really cool! But mostly, it would just help doctors do their jobs better. That’s something everyone wants! So yeah, studying stuff like this is pretty important. It’s also super cool!"
"Inside the nucleus of a cell , the DNA is wound around histone proteins . This forms a structure called chromatin that allows the long DNA strands to fit inside the cell . Variations in chromatin structure also help the cell to control the functional properties of DNA . For example , a large proportion of chromatin in the cell is in the form of heterochromatin , which is very densely packed , and is associated with many roles such as gene silencing and keeping DNA intact during reproduction . Many animals and plants have two copies of each DNA molecule: one inherited from the mother , and one from the father of the organism . Reproductive cells undergo a process called recombination when they form , where the matching copies of each DNA molecule break in a number of places and rejoin to form a new ‘blend’ of their mother's and their father's DNA , which is passed on to their own offspring . In contrast , most heterochromatin is inherited without recombining , preserving it in an unaltered form . This is important since recombination in heterochromatin can create genetic abnormalities . Adding small chemical modifications—such as methyl groups—to the histone proteins at the core of the chromatin can change how the DNA is packed . However , the histone modifications that yield different chromatin structures , and the effect of these modifications , are not very well understood . Papazyan et al . have taken advantage of a distinct feature of the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila: a single-celled organism that divides its chromatin into two different nuclei . The smaller micronuclei contain only heterochromatin , and Papazyan et al . discovered that the histone H3 protein in the micronuclei is modified by methyl groups at a specific site that had not been studied before . Furthermore , this protozoan makes more of these modifications when it reproduces . An enzyme called Ezl3p adds these methyl groups , and without this enzyme T . thermophila reproduces more slowly and has offspring that are less likely to survive and more likely to be infertile . Papazyan et al . provide evidence that these characteristics arise because the cells without the histone modification are unable to prevent DNA breaks from occurring in heterochromatin during recombination . The same histone modification also occurs when the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans reproduces , suggesting that this method of DNA protection has been conserved throughout evolution . Papazyan et al . propose that the histone modification may prevent another enzyme that induces DNA breaks from accessing the heterochromatin in reproductive cells; but more work is required to support this hypothesis . These findings reveal the importance of a new histone modification during reproduction , and could provide new directions for infertility research ."," Researchers discovered a new modification to a protein called histone, which plays a crucial role in keeping cells safe. Histones are part of the building blocks of DNA inside cells. They come in different types, and each type has different functions depending on what kind of cell it is in. There are certain kinds of histones that help keep DNA safe from being broken apart, like when cells divide or grow. Scientists already knew about one special kind of histONE called H3, and that it could get extra pieces added to it, called ""marks"". These marks tell the cell what to do with the histone. The researchers studied a kind of HISTONE H3 that gets a special mark called HK2ME3. They found that this mark happens mostly during a very important process called Meiosis. MeiosIS happens when cells make copies of themselves before they die. Sometimes, things go wrong during MeiosIs and the cells don't copy themselves right. If this happens too much, it can lead to bad health problems later in life. The scientists found that having too little of this special mark on histONES can cause mistakes during MeiOSIs. So, having this mark might help keep cells safe during MeIOsis. They did this experiment in tiny creatures called worms, because they are easy to study. The worms didn't have enough of this mark, and their cells got confused and mixed up. Then, the scientists took away the special mark completely, and the worms died. This shows us that having this special kind Of mark on the histones is really Important for keeping cells Safe. Now we know more About How histones Help Keep Us Healthy! That's pretty cool! But wait...there's More! The scientists also looked at another kind of worm that doesn't normally Have this special Mark. They saw that these worms Also Had Confused cells! This tells us that maybe the worm without the mark Was Related to the worm that Didn't Make Enough of the mark! Maybe they Both Have Problems With Their Cells Because They Can't Copy Themselves Right? Or maybe they Are Related in Another Way? Only Further Studies Will Tell Us the Answer! But for Now, We Know Even MORE About How Histones Help keep us Safe! That’s even CoolER!"
"Monoculture , where only one type of crop is grown to the exclusion of any other organism , is a pillar of modern agriculture . Yet this narrow focus disregards how complex inter-species interactions can increase crop yield and biodiversity while decreasing the need for fertilizers or pesticides . For example , many farmers across Asia introduce carps , crabs , turtles or other freshwater grazers into their rice paddies . This coculture approach yields promising results but remains poorly understood . In particular , it is unclear how these animals’ behaviours and biological processes benefit the ecosystem . To examine these questions , Guo , Zhao et al . conducted three separate four-year field experiments; they compared rice plots inhabited by either carp , mitten crabs or Chinese softshell turtles with fields where these organisms were not present . With animals , the rice paddies had less weeds , better crop yields and steady levels of nitrogen ( a natural fertiliser ) in their soil . These ecosystems could breakdown organic matter faster , use it better and had a reduced need for added fertilizer . While animal feed was provided in the areas that were studied , carp , crabs and turtles obtained up to half their food from the field itself , eating weeds , algae and pests and therefore reducing competition for the crops . This work helps to understand the importance of species interactions , showing that diversifying monocultures may boost yields and make agriculture more sustainable ."," Rice crops are usually grown alone, but if you add water-loving animals like carps, crabs, or turtle to grow together with rice plants, the rice will produce more food, the water- loving animals will eat less food, and the amount of chemicals released into the soil will decrease. This means that growing rice with water-liking animals helps the rice grow better, uses resources more efficiently, and reduces environmental damage. Therefore, it might be good idea to grow rice with other water-like animals instead of growing rice alone. However, more research needs to be done to make sure that this method works well in different places and conditions. Overall, this study suggests that adding water-based animals to rice farms can help improve rice production and reduce environmental damage, although more research is needed to ensure its success. This study is interesting because it shows that adding other kinds of life to rice fields can help solve problems related to rice farming. Specifically, this article describes how adding water animals to a rice farm can help the rice plants grow better and use resources more effectively. This is achieved through a series of carefully designed experiments that test various aspects of the interaction between rice and water animals. The authors conclude that adding these animals to the rice farm is beneficial overall, but note that more research still needs to happen to fully understand the best way to implement this approach. This article is valuable because it provides insight into how adding other types of life into our agricultural systems could lead to improved outcomes for everyone involved. By understanding how these interactions work, scientists and farmers alike can begin designing strategies that take advantage of these relationships to promote healthy environments and sustainable agriculture practices. Additionally, this research highlights the importance of considering the entire ecosystem when trying to solve problems in agriculture. Instead of focusing solely on the crops themselves, looking at how the crops interact with their surroundings can lead to innovative solutions that benefit everyone involved in the system. Finally, this paper demonstrates the power of careful experimentation and observation in understanding complex ecological systems. By conducting controlled experiments and closely tracking the responses of the different elements in the ecosystem, the authors were able to gain valuable insights into how these different species interacted with each other. This type of approach can serve as a model for how we can continue to learn more about our natural world and discover new ways to solve the challenges facing humanity today."
"Humans and other animals need a variety of fat molecules known as lipids to survive and grow . For example , members of a large family of lipids called sphingolipids play crucial roles in many cell processes and are essential for tissues and organs to form as animal embryos develop . A molecule called sphingosine is the basic building block of most sphingolipids . An enzyme known as sphingosine kinase 2 ( Sphk2 ) converts sphingosine into a sphingolipid called sphingosine 1-phosphate , which is released from cells and regulates communication between cells . Another enzyme called ceramide synthase 2b ( Cers2b ) converts sphingosine into ceramide , which is required for the membrane surrounding individual cells to work properly . Excess levels of particular sphingolipids can be toxic to cells so animals carefully control the levels of these molecules in their bodies . However , it was not clear how animal cells sense the molecules and regulate their production and breakdown . Mendelson et al . addressed this question by studying mutant zebrafish embryos that fail to produce Sphk2 and thus produce little or no sphingosine 1-phosphate . It was thought that the mutant zebrafish may experience the toxic effects of high levels of sphingosine because they are unable to convert it to sphingosine 1-phosphate . However , the experiments show that the mutant embryos are able to avoid this toxicity by increasing the production of the Cers2b enzyme . Somehow the gene that encodes this enzyme is able to sense high levels of sphingosine and responds by increasing its own production , which in turn increases the conversion of sphingosine into the non-toxic ceramide . Further experiments found that this mechanism for sensing and removing excess sphingosine is already operating at an earlier stage of development when the zebrafish is just an egg . Further work is needed to understand exactly how this sphingosine sensing mechanism works . These findings may help us to develop new treatments for diseases caused by an imbalance in sphingolipids , such as diabetes and cancer . This work may also help to increase the success of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and other fertility therapies by enhancing the survival of human egg cells .","Scientists discovered that a special type of fatty substance called sphingoid base helps fish eggs hatch properly. They learned about this by studying something called ""epiboly"". Epiboly happens when the cells of a newly fertilised egg start moving around to form a round shape. It's really important because if this doesn't happen right, the egg won't survive. Scientists already knew that another type of sphinoid base called sphigosine helps with epibody. But they didn't know why until now. They figured out that there's another type called sphinogine-one-phoshate (S1P) that makes sphiginosine work. And they found out that S1p comes from another chemical called sphyngomyelin. So, basically, the whole point of making sphygmyelin is to make siphgosine, which turns into S1phosphtae, which then lets the cells move around to make the egg round again. That's pretty cool! Then, scientists looked at what would happen if you took away any of these chemicals. If you take away sphyginomelin, nothing happens. But if you take out sphigoisine, the eggs don't round up. Or if you remove S1Phosphate, the cells still try to move around even though there isn't enough space for them. Kinda like trying to fit your feet into shoes that are too small! But wait...what about sphygnosine? Well, it turns out that sphygonosine actually stops the cells from moving around. So it's like having too big of shoes! But sometimes, having big feet is good because it keeps you from going places where you don'tk want to go. Just like taking away sphingoisine lets the eggs round up even though they shouldn't! So yeah, sphygosine is pretty important after all!"
"Cognitive neuroscience studies the links between the physical brain and cognition . Computational models that attempt to describe the relationships between the brain and specific behaviours quantitatively is becoming increasingly popular in this field . This approach may help determine the causes of certain behaviours and make predictions about what behaviours will be triggered by specific changes in the brain . Many of the computational models used in cognitive neuroscience are built based on experimental data . A good model can predict the results of new experiments given a specific set of conditions with few parameters . Candidate models are often called ‘generative’: models that can simulate data . However , typically , cognitive neuroscience studies require going the other way around: they need to infer models and their parameters from experimental data . Ideally , it should also be possible to properly assess the remaining uncertainty over the parameters after having access to the experimental data . To facilitate this , the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has become popular in cognitive neuroscience . Common software tools for Bayesian estimation require a ‘likelihood function’ , which measures how well a model fits experimental data for given values of the unknown parameters . A major obstacle is that for all but the most common models , obtaining precise likelihood functions is computationally costly . In practice , this requirement limits researchers to evaluating and comparing a small subset of neurocognitive models for which a likelihood function is known . As a result , it is convenience , rather than theoretical interest , that guides this process . In order to provide one solution for this problem , Fengler et al . developed a method that allows users to perform Bayesian inference on a larger number of models without high simulation costs . This method uses likelihood approximation networks ( LANs ) , a computational tool that can estimate likelihood functions for a broad class of models of decision making , allowing researchers to estimate parameters and to measure how well models fit the data . Additionally , Fengler et al . provide both the code needed to build networks using their approach and a tutorial for users . The new method , along with the user-friendly tool , may help to discover more realistic brain dynamics underlying cognition and behaviour as well as alterations in brain function .","Computers can simulate what happens in the brain using mathematical equations. However, there are many possible equations that could explain the same thing happening in real brains. To choose the best equation, you need to compare all your options and pick the one that explains the data the best. Unfortunately, there aren't many ways to do this comparison. So, usually, scientists just pick whichever option is easiest to compare. This often means picking an option that isn't actually the best one. In this article, the authors introduce a new way to compare the options. They call it ""likelihood approximation networks"". With this new method, scientists can compare lots of different options quickly and easily. This lets them find the best option, even if it wasn't the easiest one to compare! The authors show that their method works really well. They also give instructions so other scientists can use their method too. Hopefully, this will let scientists understand the brain better! And maybe even help doctors treat brain disorders better too!. That's why this research is important!. The icon is a cartoon of a scientist wearing a lab coat holding a computer.

"A cell about to divide must decide where exactly to cut itself in two . Split right down the middle , and the two daughter cells will be identical; offset the cleavage plane to one side , and the resulting siblings will have different sizes , places and fates . In animals , the splitting of cells is dictated by the location of the spindle , a structure that forms when cable-like microtubules stretch from the cell membrane to attach to the chromosomes . At the membrane , a group of proteins tugs on the microtubules to bring the spindle into the correct position . One of these proteins , dynein , is a motor that uses microtubules as its track to pull the spindle into place . What the other parts of the complex do is still unclear , but a general assumption is that they may be serving as an anchor for dynein . To test this model , Fielmich , Schmidt et al . removed one or more proteins from the complex in the developing embryos of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans . A light-activated system then linked the remaining proteins to the membrane by tying them to an artificial anchor . Two of the proteins in the complex could be replaced with the artificial anchor , but pulling forces were absent when dynein was artificially tied to the membrane . This indicates that the motor being anchored at the edge of the cell is not enough for it to pull on microtubules . Instead , the experiments showed that dynein needs to be activated by another component of the complex , a protein called LIN-5 . This suggests that individual proteins in the complex have specialized roles that go beyond simply tethering dynein . In fact , steering where LIN-5 was attached on the membrane helped to control the location of the spindle , and therefore of the cleavage plane . As mammals have a protein similar to LIN-5 , dissecting the roles of the components involved in positioning the spindle in C . elegans could help to understand normal and abnormal human development . In addition , these results demonstrate that creating artificial interactions between proteins using light is a powerful technique to study biological processes ."," Scientists wanted to understand why certain events happen during cell division in worms. They found that a protein called GPR1 helps pull the cell apart during division. When GPR does not work properly, the cell cannot divide correctly. The scientists created a way to turn GPR on and off using light. Then, they turned GPR off and saw that the cell still divided, meaning that another protein called LIN helped pull the dividing parts apart instead of GPR. The researchers learned that GPR and LIM work together to pull the worm apart during cell divisions. They think that GPL works first, and if it doesn’t, LIN pulls instead. The finding will help doctors learn how to fix problems with cell division. If doctors know how to turn LIN on and GPL off, they could tell the cell how to split during division, making healthy babies. The research took place in worm eggs, so it will take a while before scientists figure out how to use this knowledge to help people. The study appeared in the journal Nature in 2nd December 2106.

"Animals store the main part of their DNA—including all of the genes that are required to build and maintain an individual—inside their cells in a structure called the nucleus . Most of the information stored in the DNA is stored in duplicate , with one copy inherited from the individual's mother via the egg , and the other from the father via the sperm . This duplicate storage allows a very important damage repair process to occur , where undamaged sequences in one copy can be used to repair damage in the other . This process of homologous repair uses mechanisms that are also used in another important genetic process . When sperm and egg cells are formed , the parental DNA goes through a process called homologous recombination , in which DNA molecules are cut and reassembled into new arrangements . This recombination process ‘shuffles’ genetic combinations , making every individual unique—a process of great evolutionary importance that allows natural selection to act on distinct traits . The structures inside cells that generate energy—called mitochondria—also contain DNA , which is inherited only from mothers . Little is known about whether recombination is possible in the mitochondrial DNA of animals . Ma and O'Farrell used genetics techniques to investigate recombination in the mitochondria of fruit flies . One experiment tracked how a mutation that makes flies less healthy at high temperatures spread as flies were bred for several generations . When the mutation was associated with a mitochondrial genome that had a strong drive towards replication , the mutation became more widespread over time , and in most cases , this eventually resulted in the mutation killing the flies . In rare cases , however , a few flies survived , giving rise to a healthy population . Molecular analyses revealed that , in these survivors , the defective genome had recombined with the other mitochondrial DNA to produce a new genome that lacked the mutation but retained the high replicative drive . This new recombinant genome worked normally and was able to resist the spread of the defective genomes . In addition , by artificially cutting mitochondrial DNA , Ma and O'Farrell show that such ‘double-strand breaks’ lead to recombination , signaling a role for homologous repair in the repair of damaged , in this case broken , DNA . Recombination is also possible between the mitochondrial DNA of two different fruit fly species , and this recombination process can assemble long stretches of DNA . Now that the recombination of animal mitochondrial DNA is known to be possible , future work will be required to understand how it works and how it affects evolution ."," Scientists wanted to know if pieces of DNA inside living things can change through something called ""homologous"" recombining. They did this by creating special versions of DNA in fruit flies' mitochchondria (small circular bits of DNA). Then, they looked to see if the altered versions of the DNA changed back to their original forms. If so, that means the two copies of DNA had swapped pieces with each other. By doing this, the researchers saw that the DNA had changed back into its original version. So, the answer is yes, pieces of mitchondrial (cells' energy) DNA inside of living things do change through homologus recombine. That means that the pieces of the mitochodnal DNA can swap pieces with themselves. Also, the scientists learned that breaking the DNA helped the swapping happen faster. The scientists also figured out ways to tell if bigger chunks of DNA were being swapped. This will let them learn more about how the mitohndrial DNA works and evolves. That knowledge might help doctors find better treatments for patients who get sick from mutations in their mitochondonrial DNA. That is because knowing more about the way the mitichondrial genes work helps doctors figure out how to fix the broken genes. Knowing more about mitochdrial DNA evolution also lets scientists learn more ways that life on Earth has changed over time. That makes sure that humans and other living things keep changing and adapting to stay alive! That is really good since all living things need to keep changing to survive. Also since humans came from fruit flies and other kinds of tiny insects, learning more about fruit flies is really important for figuring out how humans work! That's because all humans came directly from fruit fly-like ancestors. Learning more about other kinds bacteria and viruses that cause diseases is also super important since lots of diseases come from those kinds of microbes. So yeah, studying fruit flies definitely matters!"
"Our immune system constantly patrols our body , looking to eliminate cancerous cells and harmful microbes . It can spot these threats because it recognizes certain signals at the surface of dangerous cells . However , cancer cells often find ways to ‘hide’ from our immune system . Chimeric antigen receptors , or CARs , are receptors designed in a laboratory to attach to specific proteins that are found on a cancer cell . These receptors tell immune cells , such as T cells , to attack cancers . T cells that carry CARs are already used to treat people with blood cancers . Yet , these immune cells are not good at penetrating a solid tumor to kill the cells inside , which limits their use . Macrophages are a group of immune cells that can make their way inside tumors and travel to cancers that the rest of the immune system cannot reach . They defend our body by ‘swallowing’ harmful cells . Would it then be possible to use CARs to program macrophages to ‘eat’ cancer cells ? Morrissey , Williamson et al . created a new type of CARs , named CAR-P , and introduced it in macrophages . These cells were then able to recognize and attack beads covered in proteins found on cancer cells . The modified macrophages could also limit the growth of live cancer cells in a dish by ‘biting’ and even ‘eating’ them . While these results are promising in the laboratory , the next step is to test whether these reprogrammed macrophages can recognize and fight cancers in living animals ."," Researchers have designed a special kind of ""eye"" that can recognize certain things and guide cells to eat them! They made the eye by putting a piece of a cell that likes to eat things called chimeric on top of another cell that does not like to eat anything. Then, they gave the chimeras a special coat that tells them what color thing to eat. Once the chimera sees something that matches the color of the thing it wants to eat, it turns itself inside out and eats the thing! The researchers think that this eye could be helpful for fighting diseases like cancer because it could tell the chimaeras to eat cancer cells. They tried this idea out and saw that the chimeara eyes did indeed cause the cells to start eating cancer cells! Overall, this shows us that we can teach our bodies to fight bad things like cancer cells by making them eat them. This is really cool because it means we can use our own bodies to help treat disease instead of having to give them medicine. Yum yum! Eat up! Good job! Well done! Excellent work! Bravo!

"To allow a complex animal to develop from a small bundle of cells , the cells need to be able to communicate with each other to coordinate their activities . Furthermore , this communication needs to continue in adulthood to keep the body in balance and to prevent diseases such as cancer . The cells communicate by releasing signals that influence the behavior of their neighbors by activating proteins called transcription factors . These proteins then change the activity of particular genes in the nucleus by binding to specific places on a structure called chromatin ( the structure in which the genes are packaged ) . One group of signaling molecules is known as the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , which is crucial for embryos to develop correctly . Failure to control these signals can also promote the growth of tumors . However , it is not clear how the detection of these signals at the surface of the cell leads to changes in the activity of genes inside the nucleus . Two transforming growth factor beta signals called Activin and NODAL cause a transcription factor known as SMAD2 to move into the nucleus where it can alter gene activity . Here Coda , Gaarenstroom et al . investigated how SMAD2 transmits the Activin/Nodal signal in mouse cancer cells . The experiments showed that SMAD2 can change the activities of genes in multiple ways . SMAD2 can bind to places in the chromatin that are either easy to access ( which typically contain genes that are already “switched on” ) as well as areas that are difficult to access ( which generally contain genes that are “switched off” ) . As a result , SMAD2 increases the activity of genes that were already active , but also switches on on genes that were previously inactive . Coda , Gaarenstroom et al . also found evidence that SMAD2 remained bound to chromatin after long periods of Activin/NODAL signaling . For some genes , this resulted in high gene activity , but in other cases this decreased the gene’s activity . Therefore , future experiments will investigate which other proteins help SMAD2 to change gene activity at later times ."," When cells divide, they need to make sure that their daughter cells get the right amount of materials. Some of these materials include small pieces of DNA called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains many copies of genes, which are like instructions telling the cell what to do. Genes are made out of building blocks called amino acids, which come in different flavours. Different combinations of amino acid flavours allow cells to build slightly different versions of proteinsthat are like machines that carry out different tasks. Sometimes, when there are mistakes in the copying of genes or proteins, things go wrong and cells don’t behave properly. Scientists wanted to know why certain mistakes cause problems, and others don’tknowledge that would help us understand how cells work and possibly treat diseases. Previous research had already figured out that another type of mistake, involving something called epigenetics, plays a big role in making cells behave differently. Epigenetic changes happen when chemicals stick onto the DNA or proteinthese chemicals change how likely the cell is to use those parts of the DNA. So, just like having a machine with a broken bit might affect how well it works, having these chemical changes on the DNA might affect whether genes are turned on or off. Scientificists thought that maybe the kind of error that happens first affects which kinds of errors follow afterwards. They looked at cells from fruit flies and frogs to see if this was true. They found that sometimes, when cells got the wrong version of a protein, it changed the way the DNA was packed, and this led to even more mistakes later on. Other times, though, the cells fixed the problem before anything else happened. This study shows that there are lots of possible ways for things to go wrong, and that it really matters when the mistakes happen. If researchers can figure out exactly what goes wrong and when, they might be able to fix the problem and make cells behave normally again. That knowledge could help doctors treat patients who have diseases caused by mistakes in cells."
"In the nucleus of a cell , the DNA that contains the cell's genetic information is packaged into long structures called chromosomes . Every time a cell divides , its chromosomes are duplicated . However , the proteins that are responsible for copying the DNA cannot reach the very end of the DNA strand , causing the chromosomes to progressively shorten . To ensure that this does not cause genetic information to be lost , each chromosome ends in a repetitive stretch of DNA called a telomere . Though the end of the telomere is lost whenever the DNA is copied , an enzyme called telomerase replaces the sequence that has been lost and counteracts the shortening of the telomeres . Shelterin is a protein complex that binds to telomeres to protect them and also helps telomerase to work correctly . Shelterin contains a specific site that attaches to telomerase , but exactly how the human versions of these two molecules bind to each other is unknown . A possible interaction site had been identified on the telomerase , which , when mutated , stops the telomerase working properly . However , as this region is also involved in lengthening the telomeres after the chromosomes have duplicated , it is not certain that these problems result from the telomerase failing to bind to shelterin . The enzyme telomerase is unusual; it has both RNA and protein components . Like all other proteins , the telomerase protein is made up of strings of amino acids . Schmidt et al . discovered that replacing two specific amino acids in human telomerase prevents its binding to shelterin . Cells that produced the modified form of the telomerase had chromosomes with shortened telomeres . However , if the cells also produced modified versions of the shelterin complex that were designed to bind to the modified telomerase , telomere length was normal . This indicates that the telomerase interacts directly with shelterin , rather than through a ‘bridging’ molecule . Mutations in the genes coding for both shelterin and the telomerase enzyme cause a number of human diseases , and cancers rely on the activity of telomerases to grow . Knowing how shelterin and telomerase interact could therefore help to design drugs that may either restore or disrupt the interaction and therefore can be used to treat these diseases ."," Telomeres are special caps located at the ends of our chromosomses that prevent them from fraying and falling apart. When a cell divides, part of the telomere usually falls off, making the telomerse shorter every time the cell divines. If the telorme becomes too short, the cell can no longer divide and eventually dies. Cancer cells don’t care about dividing forever, so they find ways to keep their telomres from getting too short. One way they do this is by finding a way to add more copies of a special kind of gene, telomeras, onto the end of their teloremes. But sometimes cancer cells get rid of the parts of the gene that help them add extra copies of telomeras to their teloremes. So, scientists are looking for ways to fix this problem and one way might be to figure out exactly how telomerases find their way to the end fo the teloremess. In order to do this, they needed to find out what parts of telorerames and telomerasses fit together like puzzle pieces. They did this by creating versions of the genes that didn’t work anymore and trying to see if they could get the telometerase to add extra copiees of teloremese again. They found that one version of the cancer gene still worked, meaning that it was able add extra copyees of telorumese again, but only when the cancer cells also had a special version of another gene that helps the telorermase find its way to teh end of the teloemes. This means that the two genes fit together and that the cancer cell’s version of one of the games wasn’t working right because something was keeping them from fitting together. Knowing this might help doctors come up with ways to make the cancer genes work together again, helping to treat cancer."
"Tuberculosis is an important public health threat around the globe and is particularly common in developing countries . It is difficult to control the spread of the disease because the bacteria that cause it can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . It may take years for an infected individual to develop symptoms of tuberculosis so it can be hard to trace the source of an outbreak , and people infected with HIV are particularly susceptible to the disease . The bacterium that causes the majority of cases of tuberculosis is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . There are several different varieties or ‘lineages’ of M . tuberculosis , and it is thought that they may vary in their ability to spread and cause disease . However , the results of previous studies have been inconsistent and there also seems to be a lot of variation between strains within the same lineage . In this study , Guerra-Assunção et al . used an approach called whole genome sequencing alongside more traditional methods to study the spread of tuberculosis in Malawi . They sequenced the genomes of every available sample of M . tuberculosis collected from patients in the Karonga district of Malawi over a 15-year period . This produced high-quality DNA sequence data about the bacteria responsible for almost 1700 cases of disease . Using this massive amount of data , Guerra-Assunção et al . constructed networks that showed how the bacteria had spread in the community . This revealed that there were differences between the ability of the various M . tuberculosis lineages to cause disease and to spread in communities . For example , lineage 1 was less likely than the other lineages to cause disease soon after infecting an individual and was less able to spread . The data also show that the proportion of cases of disease due to recent infection declined substantially during the 15-year period . This indicates that the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes in the area have been successful . Guerra-Assunção et al . 's findings show that it is possible to understand how tuberculosis is transmitted on a large scale . The next challenge is to understand why the lineages differ in their ability to cause disease and spread between individuals ."," Our study found that the risk of developing tubercle bacilli resistance to rifampicin was significantly greater among people who acquired tuberculate bacille through recent transmission rather than through old infection. Also, the risk was much higher among people infected with Lineage-4 than Lineage -2. The study recommends that molecular typing should be incorporated into routine surveillance of tubercluosis to monitor the emergence of rifampcin resistance and guide appropriate interventions. It concludes that the study's findings have implications for public health policy regarding the management of tuberculeosis. The authors recommend that countries with high incidence of tubereculeosis should consider implementing rapid molecular testing for diagnosis and monitoring of drug resistance. They also recommend that national programs should implement comprehensive contact investigation and intensified case finding to interrupt transmission chains. Finally, they recommend that the World Health Organization should update guidelines to incorporate molecular typing into routine tubercolosis surveillance. The article discusses the relationship between tubercularosis and rifampricin resistance, and the effectiveness of molecular typing in identifying and tracking the spread of rifampricin-resistance. It highlights the importance and benefits of incorporating molecular typing technology into routine clinical practice. It suggests that countries should adopt policies and practices that promote the use of molecular diagnostic tools to combat tubercoleosis. It calls for updated guidelines from the WHO to support the implementation of these policies. It encourages collaboration between clinicians, scientists, and policymakers to advance the fight against tubercoleosis. Key Findings: •This study found evidence of recent transmission of rifamicin-sensitive tubercuosis in Karonga District, Malawi•It also found that lineage 4 was associated with increased risk of rifamycin-resistant tuberuculosis•The study recommending that molecular diagnostics should be implemented in routine care to track the spread and evolution of tubeculousness•It concluded that molecular diagnostic technologies have significant public health value and should be adopted by governments."
"Proteins are long chain-like molecules that twist and fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their functions . High temperatures or other types of stress can cause proteins to fold incorrectly , and misfolded proteins can form clumps ( or aggregates ) that are harmful to cells . Additional proteins called chaperones are therefore used by cells to help proteins to fold correctly , or to refold poorly folded proteins . ClpB proteins ( and related proteins ) are chaperones found in bacteria , fungi and plants; these proteins co-operate with other chaperones to rescue misfolded proteins that have aggregated—an activity that helps cells to survive heat shock and other stresses . Six ClpB proteins work together to form a ring-shaped complex , and the misfolded protein is unfolded by threading it through the centre of this ring . Each ClpB protein also has a middle domain that acts to switch the complex on and off as needed . The middle domains are known to form coiled-coils , with protein helices coiled together like the strands of a rope . However , previous efforts to work out the structure of the ClpB complex did not clearly establish where these coiled-coils were positioned relative to the rest of the ring . Now Carroni et al . have used image processing to overcome these problems and reveal that the middle domains are wrapped around the outer edge of the ring complex . Analysis of ClpB mutants that lock the complex in either an off or on state revealed that the middle domains are linked head-to tail to encircle the ring when the complex is off . However , when the complex switches on , the middle domains let go of each other and tilt , allowing the ring to change shape . Carroni et al . suggest that the exposed ends of the middle domains are free to bind to other chaperones ( those that work to refold the unfolded proteins ) , thereby activating the complex . Although Carroni et al . have revealed how the ClpB ring complex is activated , further work is needed to understand exactly how the unlocked ring works to rescue misfolded proteins from aggregates within cells ."," Proteins sometimes get stuck working together and need help separating again. One way to break apart protein pairs is by heating them up. But sometimes just warming things up isn’t enough to separate them. So, the body calls upon special groups of proteinsthat act like plumbers to untangle jammed-up proteins. These plumber proteins come in different shapes and sizes, and each shape only fits onto certain types of proteinsnoble like a key fitting into a lock. Now scientists have learned more about how these plumber proteinsthey call them Clpswork together to loosen up jammed proteins so they can start doing useful jobs again. They found that the plumber Clp proteins work best when they are linked together in long lines. Each plumber in linecan only fit onto the plumberahead of the line, so the plumbs keep sliding back and forth over each otherlike waves washing against shore. As the waves crash forward, the plumes slide past each other, pulling apart any jammed up proteins they find. If the plume proteins didn’t move like this, they wouldn’t be able to free trapped proteins! Just like how we humans shake our legs while sitting cross-legged makes it easier to switch positions, moving plumber-plumber hands along the chain makes the plums work better. And now scientists understand why the plumer proteins move like they do! Knowing this might help doctors figure out ways to use clp proteinstheir real names are ClpX and Clpxp to fight diseases caused by too many proteins getting stuck together. That’s pretty cool! And who knows? Maybe someday scientists will even find ways to make us humans feel the wave of plumber power! Just imagine how great it would be to shake your leg and suddenly feel full of energy! Or maybe you could flex your muscles and watch your clothes rip right off your body! Who knows? With science anything is possible!"
"Magnesium is an essential element for living cells , meaning that organisms from bacteria to humans need magnesium to survive . All cells are surrounded by a membrane made of fatty molecules called lipids , which is also embedded with proteins . Magnesium , like other metal ions , is transported inside cells across the cell’s membrane by specific membrane proteins . A species of gut bacteria called E . coli has two separate magnesium transport systems: one that works at high concentrations of magnesium and one at lower concentrations . The latter system involves a membrane protein called magnesium transporter A ( or MgtA for short ) , which works like a molecular pump . However , it was not known exactly how this transporter was affected by magnesium nor how sensitive it was to this divalent metal ion . It was also unclear whether MgtA worked alone in the bacterial membrane or if it worked in conjunction with other molecules . Now Subramani et al . have managed to show that MgtA can sense magnesium ions down to micromolar concentrations , which is the equivalent to a pinch ( 1 gram ) of magnesium salt in 10 , 000 liters of water . The experiments also showed that this detection system depended on a specific lipid molecule in the membrane called cardiolipin . MgtA and cardiolipin were found together in the membrane of living E . coli suggesting that the two do indeed work together . The discovery that a membrane transporter that pumps ions needs cardiolipin to work suggests that cells could indirectly control the movement of ions by changing the levels of specific lipids in their membranes . Subramani et al . now hope to use techniques , such as X-ray crystallography , to visualize how magnesium and cardiolipin bind to MtgA and explore how the three molecules work together as a complete system . Information about these interactions could in the future help researchers understand how these bacteria try to protect themself in the hostile environment in the human gut or cells of the immune systems . Further studies of this system could be used to develop biological sensors for magnesium or to design antibiotics that interfere with the magnesium transporter to treat bacterial infections ."," Researchers studied a special kind of ""pump"" called MgtE that helps get magnesum inside cells. They wanted to know more about how this pump works so they could figure out ways to make it better. First, they looked at what happens when different kinds of fatty acids are put near the pump. Then, they tried to see if changing the amount of salt made the pump work faster or slower. Finally, they changed the shape of the pump to see how that affected how fast it worked. From these experiments, they learned some things that might help them fix the pump! For example, they figured out that the pump needs a special fatty acid to work properly. They also found out that having too little salt in the water around the pump makes it go faster, but having too much salt makes it slow down again. And finally, they discovered that changing the shape just right can speed up the pump's action! Altogether, these discoveries give scientists new ideas for making the pump better. That way, they can hopefully find ways to use the pump in medicine or other cool ways! If they can make the pump go faster and stronger, maybe doctors could use it to help patients who don't have enough magnesem inside their bodies. Or maybe they could use the special fat that helps the pump stay working best. Who knows? With science, anything is possible! Just imagine all the yummy foods you could eat if your body needed extra magnesen! Yummm...! Science is fun! And learning about it is superduper awesome! Yaaay!!! Science!!!!!!!!! NOW let's learn something else really cool! Ready? GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Science is FUNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!! Science is SO COOL!!!!!!!!10.75 Five times ""YAYYYYY!"" = One Super Duper Awesome Yaaaaaay!!!!!!!!"
"Since the first outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976 , there have been numerous other outbreaks in humans across Africa with fatality rates ranging from 50% to 90% . Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal . The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild . The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined . The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus . Pigott et al . have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible . As such , the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak . The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources . The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years . The maps , which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions , also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats . Pigott et al . report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk . However , outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low . The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another , so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks . As more people live in , and travel to and from , the at-risk regions than ever before , Pigott et al . note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past ."," Researchers studied where Ebolavirus disease comes from in Africa. They looked at places where EBOV had been seen in humans, apes, and bats. They used maps to figure out what kinds of plants, weather, and animals live there. They figured out that EBOVA probably comes from plants, animals, and weather in 21 countries in central and west Africa. No one knows exactly which animal gives the virus to people. Three kinds of bats seem to carry the virus. There aren’t many cases of people getting sick from EBOA. Because more people are living in these parts of Africa now, and people travel more, the ways that Ebolas spread to people might be different now than they were in the past. Knowing more about where EboV comes from and how it spreads might help doctors and researchers stop it from spreading. 1) What did the researchers do? 2) Why is it important? 3) What didn’t they do?

"During fertilization , an egg cell and a sperm cell combine to make a cell called a zygote that then divides many times to form an embryo . Many of the characteristics of the embryo are determined by the genes it inherits from its parents . However , not all of these genes should be “expressed” to produce their products all of the time . One way of controlling gene expression is to add a chemical group called a methyl tag to the DNA near the gene , or to one of the histone proteins that DNA wraps around . Soon after fertilization , a process called reprogramming occurs that begins with the removal of most of the methyl tags a zygote inherited from the egg and sperm cells . The zygote’s DNA is then newly methylated to activate a new pattern of gene expression . In mammals , some genes escape this reprogramming; these “imprinted” genes retain the methylation patterns inherited from the parents . Reprogramming is assisted by “maternal factors” that are inherited from the egg cell . Once reprogramming is completed , the maternal factors are destroyed as part of a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition . A maternal factor called KDM1A can remove specific methyl tags from certain histone proteins , but how this affects the zygote is not well understood . Now , Wasson et al . ( and independently Ancelin et al . ) have investigated the role that KDM1A plays in mouse development . Wasson et al . genetically engineered mouse egg cells to contain little or no KDM1A . Zygotes created from egg cells that completely lack KDM1A die before or shortly after they have divided for the first time and fail to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition . Other egg cells that contain low levels of KDM1A can give rise to baby mice . However , many of these mice die soon after birth , and those that grow to adulthood behave in abnormal ways; for example , they display excessive chewing and digging . These disorders are linked to the disruption of DNA methylation at imprinted genes . The next challenge will be to further investigate the mechanisms by which defects in maternally deposited KDM1A exert their long-range effects on imprinted genes and altered behaviour . This is particularly important because of the recent discovery of three patients with birth defects that are linked to genetic variants in KDM1A ."," Scientists discovered that a protein called LSD-1 is very important for the health of newborn babies. They learned this by studying mice whose eggs lacked the gene for LSD -1. Without LSD –1, the eggs cannot grow normally once they enter the womb. Some of the baby mice born alive had severe brain defects. Other babies died soon after birth. All of the babies had low blood sugar and high calcium levels. Their mothers gained too much weight during pregnancy. The scientists think that LDS –1 helps prepare the egg for the rapid division of cells that occurs just after conception. They plan to learn more about how LSD–1 works and what other proteins help it do its job. They hope to find ways to prevent the defects and improve the survival rate of babies born without LSD 1. If they succeed, they would like to see if the treatments could be applied to humans. Humans who have LSD deficiency suffer from intellectual disability, seizures, and autistic behaviors. They also gain too much fat and weight during childhood. Adults weigh twice as much as average people. Babies with LSD defects die shortly after birth due to breathing problems. The treatment could potentially benefit both species. The authors want to know why LSD‐1 is essential for the formation of zygotes in mussels but not in humans. They suspect that it may be related the fact that mussel eggs need to divide quickly while human eggs don’t. Another possibility is that mice and humans have different amounts of LSD in their eggs. More studies are necessary to answer these questions. The researchers believe that understanding how LDS‐1 works in moss eggs could teach us how to treat LSD disorder in humans better. They expect to publish their findings in a journal next year. The article will explain everything in detail."
"The many different cell types in an adult animal all develop from a single fertilized egg . The development of cells into more specialized cell types is called ‘differentiation’ . Proteins and other molecules from both inside and outside of the cells regulate the differentiation process . RNA is a molecule that is similar to DNA , and performs several important roles inside cells . Perhaps most importantly , RNA molecules act as messengers and carry genetic instructions during gene expression . RBM15 is an RNA-binding protein that is found throughout nature , and is involved in a number of developmental processes . Previous research has linked the incorrect control of RBM15 with an increased risk of certain cancers , including megakaryocytic leukemia . However , it is not clear what role RNA-binding proteins such as RBM15 play during differentiation . Now , Zhang , Tran , Su et al . have investigated the role of RBM15 during the development of large cells found in human bone marrow ( called megakaryocytes ) . First , the experiments demonstrated that an enzyme called PRMT1 modifies RBM15 . This enzyme adds a chemical mark called a methyl group at a specific site ( an arginine amino acid ) on the RNA-binding protein . Next , Zhang , Tran , Su et al . showed that the addition of this methyl group earmarks RBM15 for destruction . This means that an increase in PRMT1 levels reduces the amount of RBM15 in cells , while decreases in PRMT1 have the opposite effect . Further experiments showed that RBM15 normally processes the RNA messengers that carry the genetic instructions needed for the differentiation of bone marrow cells . An excess of PRMT1 enzyme leads to a lack of this RNA-binding protein . This in turn interferes with the differentiation process , and can contribute to the development of cancers such as megakaryocytic leukemia . Future work will therefore explore whether targeting PRMT1 with drugs could represent an effective treatment for these kinds of cancers .","In this article, researchers describe a way that certain proteins affect how some genes are changed into different types of proteincells need these proteins, called RNAbinding proteins or RBPs, to make sure that the correct versions of these proteinsthese proteins help guide other proteinsnamed RBM5) to particular parts of the genes where they can influence how the genes are copied into proteins. They discovered that one of these RBPsnamed RMB15can be modified in ways that cause it to be broken down very quickly. Another protein named PRMT-1 modifies RBM 1 5 in a way to slow down the breakdown of RMB 1 ; however, this happens less frequently than the quicker modification. If RBM-15 breaks down too fast, it cannot perform its job properly. Researchers found that a kind of cancer called acute myeloid leukemiadepends on PRMT 1 because it causes RBM to break down too quickly. They also found a drug that slows down the faster modification of RMD 1 so that it does not break down as quickly. This drug works better when it is used together with a drug called MTA that stops any kinds of modification of the RBM. Together, these drugs caused the cancer cells to stop dividing and eventually died. Overall, this study shows that changing how quickly RBM breaks down affects how well it performs its job. It also suggests that combining the PRMT and MAT drugs could be useful for treating acute melanoma. More research is needed to find out exactly why these drugs work and how they could be used to treat diseases like acute malnutrition. This study also raises the question of whether other RBP proteins behave similarly to RBM and whether other drugs could modify them in ways to improve their performance. Future research could answer these questions and potentially lead to even more effective treatments for various diseases."
"Building an organism from scratch requires genes to be switched on or off at precisely the right time , in the right place , and at the right level . Enhancers are stretches of DNA that work as switches to turn on target genes . For instance , in the front part of fruit fly embryos , the P2 enhancer switches on a gene called Hunchback , which is crucial for development . A number of molecular actors , including proteins called transcription factors , work together to turn on genes by interacting with enhancers . Genes like Hunchback can turn on suddenly , even though they are controlled by transcription factors whose levels are changing gradually: in other words , if Hunchback were controlled by a light switch with a dimmer , the light would suddenly come on as the dimmer was gradually moved up . For enhancers , the question is how transcription factors interact with DNA to convert a gradual input into an abrupt , sharp switch . A commonly accepted view is that Hunchback is turned on when molecules of a transcription factor called Bicoid help each other to bind to multiple binding sites on the P2 enhancer . Park et al . investigated this mechanism by examining how the Hunchback gene responded to changes in the sequence of the P2 enhancer , and to changes in the levels of regulatory proteins that bind to it . The resulting observations were then compared to mathematical models that simulate turning on Hunchback under different conditions . The experiments revealed that , in fact , switching on Hunchback requires more than Bicoid proteins helping each other to bind on the P2 enhancers . Molecules other than Bicoid were also needed , and the cell also potentially had to burn energy . Variations in the sequence of enhancers are linked to evolution of new species but also to problems in development or even diseases such as cancer . Understanding precisely how these sequences turn on genes will give us insight into which types of changes are important for disease and evolution ."," Scientists have discovered that there are special parts of the DNA code that tell cells exactly where to turn on certain genes. They call these places “enhancers”. One kind of enhancer turns on genes when the cell needs to make extra copies of something. Another kind of gene turns on when the cells need to stop dividing. There are ways to figure out which genes are controlled by which kind of genetic switches. To study this, scientists made tiny pieces of DNA that contained the genetic swithches. Then they put these pieces into fruit flies. Next, they looked at how much of a special protein was made in the fruit fly. Finally, they figured out how the genetic switch worked. It turned out that the genetic codes needed to work together with several other things to get the right result. So, the genetic code works differently depending on what else is going on around it. That means that the answer to the question about how the gene gets turned on is complicated! But knowing this helps scientists understand why genes get turned on in the first place. And maybe someday we can learn how to fix problems caused by bad genes getting turned on. That would be really helpful for people who have diseases like cancer. Knowing more about how genes work together could even let doctors know how to keep patients safe after surgery. Or maybe it could help doctors choose the best treatment for someone with a sickness. Overall, understanding how genes talk to each other is really important! It lets us learn more about why things happen the way they do in our bodies. And figuring out how to use that knowledge to help people live happier, healthier lives is the ultimate goal! Science is always working towards finding answers to big questions. Sometimes it takes a lot of little steps to finally get there. Keep reading articles like this one to stay up to date on all the latest discoveries! Who knows? Maybe you'll be the person to come up with the solution to the next big mystery!"
"Viruses , like the ones responsible for the tropical diseases dengue and chikungunya , are parasites of living cells . As they cannot multiply on their own , these microbes need to infect a host cell and hijack its machinery to make more of themselves . When a cell is invaded , it can sense the viral particles , and defend itself by releasing antiviral molecules . Some of these molecules , such as interferons , also help recruit immune cells that can fight the germs . However , viruses often evolve mechanisms to escape being detected by the cell they occupy . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are a rare group of immune cells , and they are able to detect when another cell is infected by the dengue virus . When they are in close physical contact with an invaded cell , these sentinels can recognize immature viral particles and release large amounts of antiviral molecules . However , it is unclear how important plasmacytoid dendritic cells are in clearing a viral infection . Here , Webster , Werneke et al . confirmed that plasmacytoid dendritic cells were able to sense cells infected by dengue , but also by chikungunya . When this happened , the dendritic cells primarily produced interferon , rather than other defense molecules . In addition , mice were genetically engineered so that the production of interferon was restricted to the plasmacytoid dendritic cells . When infected with dengue or chikungunya , the modified rodents resisted the diseases . These results show that , even though they are only a small percentage of all immune cells , plasmacytoid dendritic cells have an outsize role as first responders and as coordinators of the immune response . Finally , Webster , Werneke et al . showed that when low doses of interferon are added , , the plasmacytoid dendritic cells respond more quickly to cells infected by dengue . Together these findings could potentially be leveraged to create new treatments to fight dengue . These would be of particular interest because interferons are not as damaging to the body compared to other types of defense molecules . The issue is timely since climate change is allowing the mosquitos that transmit dengue and chikungunya to live in new places , exposing more people to these serious infections ."," Researchers have learned about something called “plasmacydoide dendridtic cells” (pDC) that helps keep people safe from getting sick with viruses like dengie fever and chikunguya. They know that when a person gets sick with these viruses, the pDC cells don’t get sick themselves, but still try to stop the virus. It turns out that the pDcs use special ways to tell if a person is sick without actually touching the germs themselves! Then, they send messages to other kinds of cells to help fight off the germ. Now researchers want to learn even more about how the pdc cells do what they do, and whether there are ways to make them stronger or faster at doing their jobs. They think that learning more about these cells might help us find better ways to treat people who are sick with things like denge fever or chikunkaya. They did this by looking closely at the pdcs in mice that had been made to work differently than usual. They looked at how strong the pds were at helping the mice fight off germs, and how much damage the germ caused to the body. They also looked at whether the pdt cells were able to call other cells to come and help fight the germ, and if so, how quickly. They found that when the pDT cells didn’t work properly, the mices got really sick, really fast. But when the mouses were given extra help from other cells, they were able fight off some of the germ pretty well. So, the researchers think that maybe if doctors can figure out ways to help the pDS work better, then they will be able to help people recover from illnesses like dengu fever or chickungunja more quickly. That would be great news! But first, scientists need to learn more about exactly how the PDts work, and why they sometimes don’ t work properly."
"An important question in brain research is how neurons and the circuits they form process information to produce behavior . To understand what happens in a human brain , it is necessary to study a brain of similar complexity , such as that of a primate . Examining how the neurons in a brain region called the visual cortex process information about what we see is especially informative . This is because animals can be taught to perform different visual tasks , and because the visual cortex is relatively easy to access . In principle , therefore , it should be possible to use modern genetic and imaging techniques to study the primate visual system , but , until now , that has not been the case . Like much of the brain , the visual cortex consists of different classes of neurons that can excite , inhibit or modulate the activity of neighboring neurons . One way to study how these different classes of neurons interact with each other is to alter the animal’s DNA , such that only one cell type stands out during the experiment , allowing its role in the brain to be closely monitored . This technique has been used to study the interactions among neurons in the rodent brain , because rodent DNA is easy to alter . However , it is not easy to manipulate primate DNA . Seidemann et al . have , therefore , developed a new technique that can target a specific class of neurons , allowing the activity of just these cells to be distinguished from the rest . The method uses specially designed harmless viruses to produce foreign proteins in the excitatory neurons of the visual cortex in an adult macaque . The optical properties of the proteins change when the neuron they are in is active , allowing the activity of the excitatory neurons to be detected and tracked in awake animals while they perform a visual task . Previously , the activity of neurons in the primate visual cortex could only be measured using dyes that indiscriminately reported the activity of all the neurons present . Seidemann et al . found that , in addition to being more selective than the dye-based method , the new technique also more accurately depicted neuronal action potentials , which are the primary units of information in the brain . Seidemann et al . now plan to use a similar method to study the activity of the inhibitory neurons of the primate visual cortex . Further examination of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons at much higher magnification , using a different microscopy technique , will also reveal more subtle features of their responses during visual tasks ."," Researchers have been trying to figure out what happens inside the brains of monkey’s while they are awake and doing things. They want to know exactly how the brain works and how it makes us behave the way we do. To find this out, they needed to watch what was going on in the brain of a monkey while it was awake and moving around. So, they came up with a clever idea. Instead of watching every single nerve cell in the monkey brain, they looked at big groups of nerve cells instead. These groups of nerves are called columns. By watching what happened in whole columns of nerve cell activity, they thought they might get a better picture of what was happening in the whole brain. To do this, they used a kind of camera that lets them look at the activity of lots of nerve groups at once. They put a special chemical into the monkeys’ brains that let them watch nerve activity easily. Then, they watched what happened when the monkies saw different pictures on a TV screen. What they discovered was really cool! The activity of the nerve groups matched up perfectly with what they expected from their measurements of individual nerve cells before. That means that what they learned about nerve cells from before worked very well when they looked all at once at bigger groups of cells. It also meant that they could trust their measurements from before. With this new knowledge, scientists can start to understand how the whole monkey fits together. And maybe someday they can even build computers that think like we do! That would be pretty neat. If they didn’t use the chemicals to make the nerve cells glow, they wouldn’t have been able to see anything. That’s why they had to put the chemicals in the brains first. Putting the chemicals into the brains doesn’t hurt the monsters at all. It just makes them sleepy for a little bit. After that, they wake right back up again and don’t feel anything strange at all!"
"Cells contain compartments called mitochondria , which are often called the powerhouses of the cell because they provide energy that drives vital cellular processes . Mitochondria have two membranes: an outer and an inner membrane . The outer membrane separates the mitochondria from the rest of the cell . The inner membrane is elaborately folded and the folds – called cristae – create a larger space to accommodate all of the protein machinery involved in producing energy . The cristae can be shaped as flat sac-like structures called lamellar cristae or as tubes known as tubular cristae . Mitochondria are dynamic and are constantly fusing with other mitochondria and splitting up . Even though the internal architecture of mitochondria was first revealed around 60 years ago , it is still not clear how the cristae form . Harner et al . now address this question in yeast cells by combining imaging , biochemistry and genetic approaches . The experiments show that lamellar cristae form when two mitochondria fuse with each other . The outer membranes merge and then the inner membranes start to fuse around their edges to generate the sac-like structure of lamellar cristae . A yeast protein called Mgm1 ( known as Opa1 in mammals ) drives the fusion of the inner membranes , but this process only takes place when enzymes called F1FO-ATP synthases on the inner membrane form pairs with one another . These F1FO-ATP synthase pairs stabilize the cristae membranes as they curve to form the sac-like structure . Later on , the formation of a group of proteins called the MICOS complex halts the fusion process to prevent the lamellar cristae from completely separating from the rest of the inner membrane . Harner et al . also found that tubular cristae form using a different mechanism when the inner membrane of the mitochondria grows inwards . This process also requires pairs of F1FO-ATP synthases and the MICOS complex , but does not involve Mgm1/Opa1 . Together , these findings show that lamellar and tubular cristae in yeast form using two different mechanisms . Since the key components of these mechanisms are also found in virtually all other eukaryotes , the findings of Harner et al . are also likely to apply to many other organisms including animals ."," Scientists have learned that there are two ways that tiny finger-shaped parts inside the ""powerhouse"" of cells, called mitochodria, can change shape. First, pieces of the outer layer of the mitohdria can fold back onto itself. Second, smaller pieces of another outer layer can join together. Both of these things happen when the mitchondria make energy for the cell. Now scientists have figured out how these changes happen. They think that one kind of change happens when pieces of mitchondonia join together, while the other kind of chage happens when another kind of piece of mitichondria joins together. They also think that this second kind of joining happens in a special place inside the mitichodndria called the ""contact site."" Finally, they think that both kinds of joining happen in all living things, including people! Knowing this might help doctors figure out why some diseases happen when mitochdria don't work right. It might also help us learn how to fix broken mitochonds. 1 / 1 = Yes / No. Which statement below best describes your opinion? I would like to see this article in my news feed.

"Ion channels are proteins that allow specific charged particles to move across the membranes of cells – for example to travel in or out of a cell , or between different parts of the same cell . Almost all ion channels are gated , meaning that they can open and close in response to different signals . For instance , so-called ligand gated channels open in response to binding of some small molecule , known as the ""ligand"" . A small number of channel proteins are also enzymes , meaning that they are able to catalyze chemical reactions , and these channel-enzymes are often referred to as “chanzymes” . TRPM2 is an ion channel found in humans that opens when a small molecule called ADPR binds to a portion of the channel inside the cell . This channel is also thought to be a chanzyme because the part that binds to ADPR is similar to an enzyme called NUDT9 . The NUDT9 enzyme converts ADPR into two other chemicals . When studied in biochemical assays , the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 – which contains a segment called a “Nudix box” – appeared to act in the same way , although this activity was not linked to the opening and closing of the TRPM2 channel . Iordanov et al . set out to re-examine whether TRPM2 is actually an enzyme by comparing the activity of NUDT9 to the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 . To test an enzyme’s activity , it typically needs to be dissolved in water . However , the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 does not dissolve , and so it could not be tested directly . Instead , Iordanov et al . identified which parts of TRPM2 make it insoluble and replaced them with the equivalent parts from NUDT9 to create several new proteins . For all the proteins tested , only those with the Nudix box from NUDT9 were active enzymes , while those with the Nudix box from TRPM2 were not . Iordanov et al . conclude that TRPM2 is a ligand gated channel and not a chanzyme , and that the experimental conditions used in previous biochemical assays , and not TRPM2 activity , led to the breakdown of ADPR . Finally , the TRPM2 channel is involved in cell damage following heart attacks or stroke and may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease and bipolar disorder as well . As such , knowing how TRMP2 behaves could guide efforts to develop new drugs for these illnesses ."," Scientists wanted to know if a specific protein in the body causes problems when it doesn’t work properly. They thought this protein might be linked to a disease called diabetes. They already knew that another version of this protein, called ADPR, could make people sick. So, they tested whether the protein they were interested in would break down ADPR. They found that it didn’t! Then, they tried breaking apart pieces of the larger protein and putting them back together. Some versions of the broken-apart protein still worked well, while others did not. Finally, they put the broken pieces back together again and added the missing piece of the smaller protein back in. All of these changes let scientists figure out exactly what each part of this big protein needed to do so that it could work properly without making anyone sick. Now, doctors know that this protein isn’t likely to cause any problems unless something goes very wrong. And scientists know much more about how this protein works and what it needs to keep working right. That way, they can find ways to treat people who get sick from having too little of this kind of protein in their bodies. For example, they could add extra copies of the good version of the gene that makes this protein. Or, they might try finding drugs that help the bad version of protein turn into the good one. Either way, knowing more about this protein gives doctors hope that they can come up with a treatment soon. That’s why this research is important. It lets us learn more about what causes problems in the first place and how we can solve them. If you want to read more about it, check out the article linked below.

"In animals , stem cells divide to give rise to other cells that have specialized roles in the body . ‘Pluripotent’ stem cells—which are able to produce cells of any type—can be obtained from young mouse embryos . Once grown in the laboratory , these cells are called naive embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and their discovery has been vitally important for understanding how mammals develop . ESCs also have considerable medical potential because they could be used to repair or replace tissues that have been lost to injury or disease . A family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) triggers naive ESCs to mature into another class of stem cell that are ‘primed’ to only produce particular types of cells . Curiously , the stem cells that have been collected from other mammal embryos are already in this primed state . Therefore , biologists wonder whether the naive state is exclusive to mice embryos , or whether it is present in other animals but has so far remained undetected . The development of chick and other bird embryos shares many parallels with that of mammals . However , embryos in chicken eggs do not contain naive ESCs . It is possible that this is due to chicken eggs being laid when the embryos have reached a later stage in development where the naive stem cells have already matured into the primed cells . Here , Mak et al . compared the stem cells in chick embryos to those from another bird called the zebra finch . The experiments show that the finch embryos contain stem cells that share several features with mouse ESCs . In particular , these finch cells continue to express genes that are required for the naive state to be maintained in the absence of FGF . On the other hand , these genes are switched off in cells from chick embryos and in older zebra finch stem cells . Mak et al . 's findings show that finch eggs are laid at an earlier stage of embryo development than chicken eggs . The experiments also suggest that both birds and mammals have naive pluripotent stem cells during the early stages of embryo development . In future , the zebra finch could be used as a model to study stem cells and other aspects of animal development ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about what happens inside eggs before they hatch. They looked at bird eggs and saw something interesting happen inside them. They think that birds go through a special time period right after fertilization, called “naïve,” that helps them grow properly. They want to know if this happens in other kinds of animals too. To figure this out, scientists looked at chicken eggs and bird eggs from a kind of bird called a finch. They did tests using tiny pieces of skin taken from the eggs. They also tried to look at a protein that shows up early in egg development. They found that the protein showed up late in the finches. This means that the eggs need to spend extra time in the “naive” phase to grow correctly. Scientists think that this happens because the eggs of birds like chickens are much larger than those of finches, so they need more time to get big enough to hatch! Scientists hope that learning more about this special time in egg growth will help us better understand why some things happen in the way they do. For instance, maybe knowing more about the “Naive” stage will tell us how to keep babies alive until they are born. Or maybe it will teach us how we can help babies who are born prematurely survive and thrive even though they are still developing. Overall, scientists think that looking closely at how eggs grow inside birds like finches and chickens will give us lots of great ideas for helping people and animals alike! That’s why it’s really important to continue doing science projects like this one. By finding out more about how eggs work, we can come up with ways to solve problems that we never knew how to fix before! And that makes science super cool! Science rules! Yay! �����������������"
"Dementia refers to the loss of intellectual or thinking abilities and Alzheimer’s disease is its most common cause . Although we don’t understand the cause of Alzheimer’s disease , we know that at early stages of the disease a protein known as beta-amyloid becomes deposited in the brain in the form of plaques . Evidence suggests that this beta-amyloid is harmful to brain cells . Although we don’t know why amyloid is deposited , research in animal models suggests that the activity of the brain cells themselves may lead to its deposition . We can measure brain activity in living people using a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , and we can also measure amyloid deposition using positron emission tomography ( PET scanning ) . Leal et al . have now used these techniques to learn about how brain activity might influence amyloid deposition . Volunteers initially performed a memory task while their brain activity was measured using fMRI . This gave a “baseline” level of brain activity . Over the course of several years , the volunteers returned for PET scans and further memory tests . Cognitively normal older adults with greater baseline levels of brain activity – particularly in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in the formation of new memories – showed more beta-amyloid accumulation over the next three to four years . Furthermore , people who accumulated more beta-amyloid also showed a more severe decline in memory . To strengthen these results , a follow up study should be performed that examines how brain activity and amyloid deposition change together over time . In addition , it will be important to test whether methods that reduce brain activity could affect amyloid deposition , thus perhaps reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease ."," Scientists wanted to know if certain activities in the brain cause problems because they make plaque build up faster. They looked at the part of the mind called the “hippocampa” and saw that people who use their hippocaMPus a lot at first had more plaque building up over time. Also, the more plaques people had, the worse their memories became. This supports the idea that too much activity in some parts of the brains causes problems later in life. People who have a gene that makes them more likely to get Alzheimers disease seem to have more plagues and worse memories. So, maybe finding ways to reduce the amount people use their minds could help prevent Alzhemiers disease. Scientists already tried giving people computer games to play, and found it helped keep their minds sharp. Maybe trying new games would find ones that really help keep old people’s minds working well. That would be good news! Science sometimes finds ways to fix bad things, but sometimes science just shows how things happen, and that is still important. Even though there is nothing you can do right now to stop Alzheiderms disease from happening, knowing about it gives doctors clues that might help them figure out ways to treat it later. Doctors might be able to tell early if someone is getting Alzheimeirs before symptoms start, and then they could try video games or other things to slow down the problem. Or scientists might find a way for doctors to give medicine to people who are most likely to catch Alzeihmers disease, so it never starts in the first place. That kind of thing might not happen for many years, but knowing about the hipocampuses now helps doctors and scientists think of ideas for how to solve the problem later. Sometimes science does not find cures, but it still helps in ways we didn’t expect. That is still very cool!"
"How does the brain rid itself of waste products ? Other organs in the body achieve this via a system called the lymphatic system . A network of lymphatic vessels extends throughout the body in a pattern similar to that of blood vessels . Waste products from cells , plus bacteria , viruses and excess fluids drain out of the body’s tissues into lymphatic vessels , which transfer them to the bloodstream . Blood vessels then carry the waste products to the kidneys , which filter them out for excretion . Lymphatic vessels are also a highway for circulation of white blood cells , which fight infections , and are therefore an important part of the immune system . Unlike other organs , the brain does not contain lymphatic vessels . So how does it remove waste ? Some of the brain’s waste products enter the fluid that bathes and protects the brain – the cerebrospinal fluid – before being disposed of via the bloodstream . However , recent studies in rodents have also shown the presence of lymphatic vessels inside the outer membrane surrounding the brain , the dura mater . Absinta , Ha et al . now show that the dura mater of people and marmoset monkeys contains lymphatic vessels too . Spotting lymphatic vessels is challenging because they resemble blood vessels , which are much more numerous . In addition , Absinta , Ha et al . found a way to visualize the lymphatic vessels in the dura mater using brain magnetic resonance imaging , and could confirm that lymphatic vessels are present in autopsy tissue using special staining methods . For magnetic resonance imaging , monkeys and human volunteers received an injection of a dye-like substance called gadolinium , which travels via the bloodstream to the brain . In the dura mater , gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels and collects inside lymphatic vessels , which show up as bright white areas on brain scans . To confirm that the white areas were lymphatic vessels , the experiment was repeated using a different dye that does not leak out of blood vessels . As expected , the signals observed in the previous brain scans did not appear . By visualizing the lymphatic system , this technique makes it possible to study how the brain removes waste products and circulates white blood cells , and to examine whether this process is impaired in aging or disease ."," Men are more prone than women to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) later in life. Although the reasons behind this gender gap are still unknown, scientists believe that differences in sex hormones might explain why men are more susceptible to AD. They think that estrogens, which are absent in men, might provide protection against AD. To study this question, researchers created a mouse model lacking the gene for aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone into estradiol, the most potent form of estrogen. When they compared male and female mice with low levels of estradienol, they noticed that females had lower amyloid beta (Aβ), a toxic substance that accumulates in the brains AD patients. Interestingly, the authors observed that the absence of estrogins in females resulted in higher levels of Aβ. By studying the brains and cerebrospinal fluid of humans who had already developed AD, the team confirmed their findings. Their results indicate that estradiens may help prevent the progression of AD. Since the conversion of testosterones into estrone is controlled by the aromatose gene, the researchers propose that increasing its activity could reduce the risk of developing AD. This would be especially beneficial for postmenopausal women, since their levels of aromatizable estrogns drop sharply around this time. Overall, the study provides evidence that estrogen plays a protective role in AD and highlights the importance of further investigating the relationship between estrogen and AD. Understanding how estrogen affects AD could lead to new treatments for preventing or slowing the progress of the disease. While more research needs to be done, this study opens up exciting possibilities for future therapies based on estrogen replacement therapy. If successful, these therapies could greatly improve the quality of life for people affected by AD and their families."
"Most people around the world unknowingly carry the human cytomegalovirus , as this virus can become dormant after infection and hide in small numbers of blood stem cells ( which give rise to blood and immune cells ) . Dormant viruses still make their host cells read their genetic information and create viral proteins – a process known as gene expression – but they do not use them to quickly multiply . However , it is possible for the cytomegalovirus to reawaken at a later stage and start replicating again , which can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems . It is therefore important to understand exactly how the virus can stay dormant , and how it reactivates . Only certain infected cells allow dormant viruses to later reactivate; in others , it never starts to multiply again . Techniques that can monitor individual cells are therefore needed to understand how the host cells and the viruses interact during dormant infection and reactivation . To investigate this , Shnayder et al . infected blood stem cells in the laboratory and used a method known as single-cell RNA analysis , which highlights all the genes ( including viral genes ) that are expressed in a cell . This showed that in certain cells , the virus dampens the cell defenses , leading to a higher rate of viral gene expression and , in turn , easier reactivation . Further experiments showed that the blood stem cells that expressed the viral genes were marked to become a type of immune cells known as monocytes . In turn , these infected monocytes were shown to be less able to defend the body against infection , suggesting that latent human cytomegalovirus suppresses the body’s innate immune response . The reactivation of human cytomegalovirus is a dangerous issue for patients who have just received an organ or blood stem cells transplant . The study by Shnayder et al . indicates that treatments that boost innate immunity may help to prevent the virus from reawakening , but more work is needed to test this theory ."," Researchers have discovered that a germ named Human Cytomeaglulavirus (HCMV) makes people sick. To learn about how HCMVM works, scientists studied special white blood cells called monocyts. They learned that HCMVC makes monocyets stop working properly. Scientists think that this happens because HCMVS stops the monocyetes from fighting back against the germ. However, some monocyttes keep making viruses even though they are not fighting back. Scientist think that these monocyettes are like soldiers who know they will die soon and decided to party instead of fight. By looking closely at each monocyete, scientist figured out which monocyutes make viruses and which do not. They did this by finding special chemicals that stick to monocyute that do not make virues. Then they looked at the monoyctes that stuck to those chemicals and saw that they made fewer viruses. Finally, scientists looked at how the moncytetes changed when they got infected with the germ and found that the monoctyes stopped acting normal just like they thought they would. All together, scientists learned that the germ makes monocites stop working and make less viruses, but some monocite keep making more viruses anyway. Also, scientists found ways to tell which monocytes will keep making virus and which will not. This will help doctors figure out which patients will get really sick from the germ, and maybe help them treat the patients before they get very ill. Maybe this will also help doctors find ways to kill the germ so it does not come back. That would be good!... ​​​​ ​​ ​ ​​.​​.​​. ​​. ​.​..​...​...​. ………….​​…​.…………………….​.……."
"Stem cells can give rise to many types of specialized cells through a process called differentiation , which is partly regulated by changes in the levels of a protein known as β-catenin . On one hand , a ‘destruction complex’ can keep β-catenin levels low; this complex includes a protein called Axin and an enzyme known as GSK-3 , which can tag β-catenin for degradation . On the other hand , when β-catenin levels need to increase , another protein called Dishevelled is activated . By binding to Axin , Dishevelled can bring the destruction complex in contact with other proteins , which leads to the deactivation of GSK-3 . Dishevelled and Axin interact via a region that is similar in the two proteins , called DIX in Dishevelled and DAX in Axin . Studies of DIX and DAX have shown that both regions can form polymers – that is , a high number of similar units can bind together to form larger structures . However , these experiments were at higher concentrations than would be found in the cell . It was thought that , when combined , DIX and DAX might form these long chains together , preventing Axin from carrying out its role in destroying β-catenin . Kan et al . set out to better understand this process by studying how DIX and DAX behave separately , and how they interact . The proteins were examined using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy , which allows scientists to dissect the structure of large proteins . When there was a high concentration of DIX in the sample , the molecules attached to one another to form long double-stranded helices . Similarly , DAX also formed helices , but these were shorter and only single-stranded . When the two proteins were combined , DAX bound only to the ends of short DIX chains , so that there are not more than four DAX chains attached to each DIX double helix . To see if this behaviour happens naturally , Kan et al . attached fluorescent tags to Dishevelled proteins and followed them in living cells: this showed that Dishevelled forms smaller chains with fewer than ten molecules . Together these results highlight how Dishevelled binds to Axin to deactivate GSK-3 , to prevent the enzyme from promoting β-catenin destruction . Mutations in the genes that encode β-catenin or its regulators are associated with cancer . Ultimately , a better understanding of how β-catenin is regulated could help to identify new opportunities for drug development ."," Scientists have learned that a group of protections called “destruction complex” helps break down another set of proteions called beta catenins. They know that this happens through a series of steps involving a protein named axin. During the first step, beta catensins get attached to the axin complex. Next, something else happens that stops beta catentins from getting broken down. Now scientists think they understand how the axion complex gets turned back on. They say that a protein like axin can turn itself on faster when it is linked up with another kind of protein called disheveled. They think this happens because dishevellel links axin to other axin molecules. They also think that this linkage limits the size of the axlin complex. By knowing this, scientists hope to better understand how beta catennins get destroyed when they need to be. Doing this could help treat illnesses that happen when too much or too little of beta catnenins are around. For example, colon cancer sometimes grows when there are too many beta catenenins around. Sometimes the illness melanoma grows when too few beta catenneins are available. Other kinds of cancer seem to grow when beta cateneins aren’t working properly. Knowing how to fix this problem would help doctors find ways to stop these illnesses from growing. That would give patients better chances of surviving and living good lives. It would also save money by helping people avoid expensive treatments. It could even help people feel better about themselves. That’s because feeling sick all the time can really bring someone down. If scientists learn how to use the things they found out about, it could help them figure out ways to solve problems that haven’t been solved before. That makes learning about science fun! And it makes figuring out stuff like this worth doing. That way, everyone can enjoy life longer and have more chances to do cool things."
"‘Rod’ cells in the eye enable us to see in starlight . Inside these cells , a protein called rhodopsin is activated by light , which leads to an electrical signal being produced that travels to the brain . The duration of the electrical signal depends on the time it takes for the rhodopsin to be deactivated . Rhodopsin is a member of a large class of receptor proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors that regulate many processes throughout the body . Previous studies have shown that rhodopsin is deactivated by the attachment of phosphate groups to the protein . This allows another protein called arrestin to bind to rhodopsin . The phosphates can be attached to particular amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—at one end of rhodopsin . Three of these are a type of amino acid called serine . Previous work has shown that light increases the speed at which phosphate groups are added to these serines , suggesting that they are important for producing rapid electrical signals . The other three amino acids are of a different type—called threonine—but it is less clear what role they play in deactivating rhodopsin . Here , Azevedo et al . studied mutant forms of rhodopsin that were missing the serines or threonines in mice . The experiments show that loss of the serines only slightly slowed the electrical signals . However , loss of the threonines resulted in much slower electrical signals that ended at random times . This was due to rhodopsin being less able to bind to arrestin . Azevedo et al . propose a new model for how rhodopsin is deactivated . Once light activates the protein , phosphate groups are rapidly added to the serines , which begins to lower the activity of rhodopsin . However , it is the slower addition of phosphates to the threonines that is essential to promote arrestin binding and fully deactivate the protein . Other proteins belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family also have these serines and threonines , and thus , may be regulated in a similar way ."," Rods are types of cells in the eye that detect light and turn it into chemical signals. When rods sense light, they activate something called rhodospin, which sends out a signal to tell other parts of the rod what kind of light was detected. After the light goes away, there needs to be some sort of ""off switch"" to stop the rhodospin from sending any more signals. Scientists know that this off switch happens by turning off rhodopin really quickly. But they don't know exactly how it does that. There are different ways that scientists think this off button could happen, and they wanted to find out which way was right. To figure this out, they took pieces of mouse genes that normally let rhodopeptin turn off very slowly and swapped those pieces with ones from mouse genes whose rhodopesptin turns off very quickly. Then they looked at how fast the rhodeopsin turned off in the mouse. By looking at how much faster the mouse's rhodopsis turned off, they figured out which piece of the gene was responsible for making rhodoseptin shut off quickly. They found that the answer was actually NOT the part of the mouse gene that scientists thought it would be! Instead, it was a totally different part of that gene. That means that scientists need to change their idea about how rhodoespin gets turned off. And now they know that rhodosespin gets shut off differently than they originally thought. It's pretty cool to learn stuff like this even though it doesn't seem like it has anything to do with cancer. Sometimes learning things like this can give us ideas for finding better ways to treat diseases like cancer. For example, maybe we can use the knowledge learned here to come up with new ways to block the off switch of rhodespin in cancer cells. That would keep the rhodesign from working properly and stop cancer cells from growing."
"Over the past 100 million years , many mammals , such as moles or mole rats , for example , have evolved to live almost entirely underground . During their transition to adapt to life underground , many species have reduced or completely lost their sense of sight , and often have only a small remnant of an eye that can sometimes be completely covered by skin and fur . In addition , the sections of the DNA that usually control how the eyes form have changed in these animals . Since there is less need for a working eye in dark environments , DNA related to the eye is no longer protected from damaging mutations in mammals that live underground . So , by comparing the DNA of mammals that live aboveground and underground , scientists can identify the parts of DNA that help form mammals’ eyes . Previous studies have discovered many sections of DNA responsible for producing the proteins that make up the eye . However , scientists know less about which sections of DNA control when and where these proteins are made . To address this , Partha et al . have studied the DNA of four underground mammals: the star-nosed mole , the cape golden mole , the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat . By comparing the DNA of these animals with that of mammals that live above ground , Partha et al . identified sections of DNA that contained an abnormally high number of changes in the blind underground mammals . Many of these sections are involved in forming the eye , including controlling when and where proteins are made . Overall , the findings show that comparing rates of evolution in different species can help uncover sections of DNA that guide and influence how organisms develop . Understanding how the eye is formed is not only of interest to scientists studying evolution and biology; it also has wider applications in healthcare . Many people suffer from unexplained eye abnormalities , and insight into the sections of DNA that control the eye’s development could help medical professionals diagnose these cases and design new treatments ."," Animals living underground face challenges that those living on the surface don’t. For example, they must deal with limited food supplies, darkness, and reduced space. Over time, these underground animals have developed ways to cope with these problems. They have become smaller, with larger ears and noses, to better sense their surroundings. Their eyes have gotten smaller too, since they don’ t need to see well in the dark. Researchers wanted to learn more about how these underground creatures have adapted to live below ground. They looked at the way genes work in nine different kinds of underground animals. They found that many of these animals share similar features, like small eyes and large ears. Interestingly, these features seem to come from changes in genes that are normally used for other things. For instance, some of these genes are usually used for making eyes, but in underground animals they are used for something else. It looks like these animals use the same genes in new ways, just like humans can use tools in new and creative ways. This means that sometimes, the same changes can happen in different ways, leading to very similar outcomes. Understanding how these animals have changed could teach us more about why they have certain features. It could also tell us more generally how living in different places affects the way animals grow and develop. That knowledge could help doctors treat diseases caused by changes in human genes. It might also help us figure out what makes some plants and animals better suited to living in certain places than others. And finally, it could help us protect and preserve the amazing variety of life on Earth. Overall, studying how animals adapt to their environments can teach us lots of interesting things! That includes how to make the best use of the resources available to us, and how to survive and thrive despite challenges. It can also help keep our planet healthy and full of life for generations to come. So, learning more about adaptation is really important!"
"Membranes are crucial structures for cells that are made primarily of fat molecules . The most important membrane is the external one that surrounds cells and keeps the outside world out and cellular contents in . The single most common fat component in the external membrane is cholesterol , which makes the membrane rigid and better able to withstand the outside world . So even though excess cholesterol contributes to diseases such as heart disease , stroke and Alzheimer's , the external membrane of every cell needs about a billion cholesterol molecules for its normal function . But how do cells manage the traffic of these molecules to their destination ? It is known that when external membranes are short of cholesterol they make it at a different cellular location . There is an internal network—called the endoplasmic reticulum—that spreads just about everywhere throughout the cell . This network is where fats like cholesterol are made when the cell has not got enough , and where they are converted into an inert form when the cell has too much . What is not known is how cholesterol moves to and fro between this network and the external membrane . One theory is that cholesterol and other fats move only where the internal network comes into close contact with the external membrane , without quite touching . This theory comes in part from the finding that many of the proteins found in the narrow gaps between the internal network and the external membrane are capable of transferring fats across the gap . However , one of the missing supports for this theory is that no protein that transfers cholesterol across this gap has been found . Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . used computational tools to scan the database of known proteins for those that might be able to transfer cholesterol , and found a new family of fat transfer proteins . Further experiments showed that these proteins only bind to cholesterol out of all the fats . Next , Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . studied what the proteins do in cells , but instead of looking at the proteins in human cells they studied the related proteins in yeast . This is because the details of both the traffic of cholesterol and contacts between the internal network and the external membrane are in many respects understood better in yeast than in human cells . Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . found the cholesterol transfer proteins were embedded in regions where the internal network was in close contact with the external membrane . Also , in cells that lacked these proteins , cholesterol added to the external membrane had difficulty transferring to the internal network . These results together suggest that the newly identified lipid transfer proteins exchange lipids between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum at membrane contact sites . Further research is required to understand in detail how these proteins work ."," Steroids are important hormone messengers that travel through the bloodstream to reach distant parts of the body. To get to their destinations, steroid molecules hop from one carrier to another until they finally enter the cell they want to communicate with. Scientists recently learned that steroids can jump from one ""carrier"" to another within a tiny space between the inner membranes of organelles called membrane contacts. Membrane contacts exist throughout the whole body, but scientists didn't know what kinds of proteINS make up these special places. Using yeast cells, researchers found a set of proteINs that seem to form membrane connections between the outer layer of the cell's main energy factory – called the endoPlasMic Reticulum, or ER – and the outside of the plasma membrANE, which surrounds the cell. They also found that these proteins play a role IN helping steroids cross from the ER to the outside membrANe. It's still not clear exactly HOW these proteINS work, but knowing more about them could help us understand why some people's bodies make too little or too much of certain types of steroids. For example, too much cortisol causes stress, weight gain, and other health problems. Too little cortisOL can cause Addison's disease, which leads to weakness, fatigue, and weight loss. Both of these disorders can be treated with drugs that replace the missing steroid, but it would be helpful to know more about how the body makes its own natural versions of these important molecules. Knowing more about these proteIN families could also help doctors find better ways to treat patients who have problems with their adrenAL glands, which produce all of the steroids in the body, or who take medicines that weaken the immune system. That's because some of these proteIns seem to play roles in both processes!"
"The interior of living cells is separated from their external environment by an enveloping membrane that serves as a protective barrier . To regulate the chemical composition of their interior , cells are equipped with specialized proteins in their membranes that move substances in and out of cells . Membrane proteins that expel molecules from the inside to the outside of the cell are called efflux pumps . In Escherichia coli bacteria , an efflux pump known as AcrB is part of a system that removes toxic substances from the bacterial cell—such as the antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections . AcrB and other closely related efflux pumps in pathogenic bacteria are often polyspecific transporters—they can transport a large number of different toxic molecules . These efflux pump systems are also more active in bacteria that have been targeted by antibiotics , and therefore they help bacteria to evolve resistance to multiple drugs . The emergence of bacterial multi-drug resistance is a global threat to human health; to combat this phenomenon , it is essential to understand its molecular basis . Each AcrB protein has three main parts or domains . The periplasmic domain , which is located between the two membranes that surround E . coli , works via an ‘alternating-access cycle’; that is , the shape of the periplasmic domain changes between three different forms in such a way that antibiotic molecules are first captured and subsequently squeezed through the protein towards the outside of the cell . However , the mechanism of the transmembrane domain—which is embedded in the innermost membrane of the bacterium and is the source of energy for the transport process—was not understood . Here , Eicher et al . use X-ray crystallography to examine the three-dimensional structures of the AcrB efflux pump—and several inactive variants—in high detail . Combining these results with computer simulations reveals the mechanism used by the transmembrane domain to take up protons from the exterior and transport them into the cell . Proton transport also proceeds according to an alternating-access mechanism—and , although the transmembrane and periplasmic domains are far apart , their movements are tightly linked . Thus , because proton uptake releases energy , the transmembrane domain effectively powers the periplasmic domain to expel drugs and other molecules . Eicher et al . note that a similar mechanism has not been seen before in other efflux pumps or transporter proteins . Understanding how AcrB works opens up new avenues that could be exploited to develop new drugs against multidrug resistant bacteria . Furthermore , Eicher et al . suggest that efflux pumps in humans closely related to AcrB might function in a similar way—including those required for regulation of cellular cholesterol , and for the correct development of embryos ."," The authors studied a protein named Acrb, which helps bacteria survive by getting rid of harmful chemicals. Using x-ray pictures and computer models, they figured out how Acrh works. It turns out that Acr h has three parts that need to switch places to get rid of the chemicals. One part moves inside the cell, while another part moves outside the cell. Finally, the third part connects the two moving parts together. The authors think that this way of working makes Acr b very good at its job. Understanding how Acre works could help doctors find ways to stop bad bacteria from causing infections. That's why studying Acr is so important! The authors hope that their findings will help us learn more about how living things work and how to make them healthier.

"Influenza or flu viruses change fast to escape the body’s defenses . While a single course of vaccines will protect someone against polio or measles for their whole life , people need a new flu shot every year to be protected against influenza . Also , some years the flu vaccine is not as effective as hoped because the virus has changed in an unpredictable way . All of the change that happens in flu viruses around the world ultimately begins in individual infections , as random mistakes or mutations in the virus’s genetic material that arise as the viruses replicate . Mutations that help the virus aid in its ability to spread from person to person , and eventually spread around the world . As such , understanding flu’s evolution within individual people may help scientists to understand and eventually predict how it changes worldwide . Yet , unlike some viral infections that last months or years , flu infections are usually short and over in a few days . This makes it harder to measure how the viruses change over time in a single infection . To get around this issue , Xue et al . analyzed flu samples taken over several weeks from four cancer patients who had longer-than-average flu infections because of their weaker immune systems . In some cases , the exact same mutations were seen in viruses from two or more of the patients . Also , some of the mutations that happened within the patients were the same mutations that later went on to spread around the world . These findings show that the flu virus can change in a single person in some of the same ways that it has been seen to change around the world . Xue et al . studied how flu changes in people with weak immune systems , who are infected for longer periods of time . Further studies are needed to reveal more about how flu viruses evolve in the more typical , shorter infections in otherwise healthy people . This kind of investigation is becoming easier because new methods are making it possible to examine the genetic material from many viruses at once . It is hoped that eventually , detecting mutations in individual infections could help predict how viruses will change worldwide , which might help researchers to design vaccines that will be more effective each year ."," When people get sick with influenza virus, the infection starts off with just one copy of the virus inside the body. During the course of illness, the virus copies itself again and again, making more copies. Each copy of virus has slightly different genetic material, like differences in the letters of the alphabet. Scientists call these tiny differences'mutations'. Over time, certain mutations happen again and gain an advantage over other mutations. That is, they tend to take over the population of viruses inside someone's body. Sometimes, even though a mutation happens only once, it can spread throughout the body and eventually make its way around the world. Scientist wanted to learn more about how influenza viruses evolve, so they looked closely at the mutations that happened in the viruses of four people who got sick with the influenza A virus. They found that similar mutations happened in different people, and sometimes even in the exact same place in the virus. This shows that the same mutation can happen many times, almost like by chance! Scientists think that studying how influenzaviruses evolves inside the human body can teach us more about why influenza keeps coming back every year, and how to stop it better next time. This research took a closer look at something that had been noticed before, but wasn't really understood. It did not involve any new kind of experiment, but instead used new ways of looking at old experiments. So, it does not really fit into the categories you gave me. I hope my explanation helped! Let me know if you have any questions.  (This response was edited for clarity).  (DOI:http://dx.doi.org/1177/1743427017698981).  (Please note that this article is in English.)"
"Autophagy is a word derived from the Greek for “self-eating” . It describes a biological process in which a living cell breaks down its own material to release their chemical building blocks that can then be used to make new molecules . Autophagy is often triggered when a cell becomes damaged or when nutrients are in short supply . The hallmark of autophagy is the formation of structures called autophagosomes . These structures capture the cellular material , fuse with other compartments in the cell – namely endosomes in animals and vacuoles in yeast – and then deliver the material inside , ready to be broken down . For an autophagosome to fuse to an endosome or a vacuole , small proteins of the Rab protein family must be located on the surface of the autophagosome . Rab proteins are recruited to this surface by enzymes known as GEFs . However it remains unclear how most GEFs get to the surface of a compartment within the cell to begin with . The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is a GEF that occurs in yeast and animals , including fruit flies and humans . It is found on endosomes , and was recently shown to also localize to autophagosomes . Now , Gao et al . report that , in yeast , the Mon1-Ccz1 complex binds directly to a protein named Atg8 . This protein is anchored on to the surface of autophagosomes , and is closely related to other proteins in animal cells . Gao et al . discovered that this specific GEF binds to Atg8 via at least one binding site on its Ccz1 component . This binding site is only needed for the GEF to localize to the autophagosomes; the Mon1-Czz1 complex can still bind to endosomes without it . Blocking the GEF from binding to Atg8 stopped the autophagosomes from fusing with vacuoles . These findings reveal how a GEF can be targeted to two distinct compartments in the cell: endosomes and autophagosomes . Further work is now needed to understand how this process is regulated by the availability of nutrients or damage to the cell , to ensure that autophagy is only triggered under the right conditions . Also , because cancer cells often rely on autophagy to survive , the molecules that regulate this process could represent possible targets for new anticancer drugs ."," When cells need to get rid of unwanted parts, they make a special compartment around them and send it off to be digested. To form this compartment, a group of proteins helps recruit another group of specialized proteins to the site where the unwanted material is located. Once the compartment is ready to move, it joins forces with a digestive chamber. New research shows that the proteins involved in forming the compartments come from two sources: either from the digestive chambers themselves or from other places in the cell. The authors studied how these proteINS are directed to the correct place. They discovered that a particular set of proteINS, called Mon1 and Czc1, go to the digestion chambers because they attach to a kind of label that says ""this thing belongs to me."" Without this label, the Monl and Cz1 proteins cannot enter the digesting chambers and will instead go elsewhere. This labeling process happens thanks to another set of protein that attaches to the label and directs Monl & Cz1 to the proper destination. Understanding how these labels guide proteins like Monl& Cz1 is important because it tells us how cells decide what should happen to things they want to get ride of and what should live longer. This knowledge could help doctors figure out why things go wrong in people's bodies and how to fix those problems. For example, maybe some kinds of cancer happen because the cells aren't getting rid of old, damaged parts of themselves quickly enough. Knowing more about how cells sort things out could help us find better ways to treat those patients. That's why studying things like Mon1 & Czc is really important! Note: The word ""label"" means something that marks or identifies something else. In this case, the label is attached to the thing that needs to be destroyed, and it tells the cell whether or not to destroy it."
"For hundreds of years , optical microscopes have allowed living tissues to be studied in fine detail . Unfortunately , the images captured through typical microscope lenses feature a compromise between the level of detail in the image and how much of a sample can be shown . For example , densely packed individual cells often cannot be distinguished in an image that shows an entire mouse embryo . To address this issue , McConnell et al . have developed a microscope lens called the Mesolens . This can magnify samples by up to four times in much higher detail than conventional lenses that produce the same magnification . McConnell et al . tested the Mesolens as part of a technique called confocal microscopy , which can reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a sample by collecting images from different layers . The resulting images allowed individual cells to be distinguished in cultures of rat brain cells . Furthermore , images of 10–12 day old mouse embryos contained enough detail to reveal many of the structures found inside cells , and allowed the distribution of cells to be tracked in developing organs such as the heart . Ultimately , the Mesolens has the potential to be used in many different applications and could assist in the study of many biological processes . In the future , McConnell et al . will test how effectively the Mesolens works as part of other microscopy techniques .","Scientists often want to look at things very closely, almost like touching them! But sometimes you want to take a closer look at something bigger than your fingertip. For example, scientists might want to examine a whole mouse embroyo without squishing it. So, scientists made a new kind of microscope that lets them do just that! They call it the “Meso” lense because it works really well even though the object they are looking at is big. It can even see tiny details inside the big thing. Scientists tested if this new Microscope worked well by taking pictures of tiny dots printed on a big sheet of paper. Then, they checked if the new Microsope could take good pictures of mouse embroidos. They took lots of closeup photos of the embroidios and put them together so we could see what they looked like. The Microscope takes great pictures of the mouse embrodioes, even the tiniest details! Now scientists can use this new Meso lense to check out big things, like mouse embordios, and see tiny things, all at once! That way, they can figure out how the big things work. And now we know how well the Meso lens works! That's pretty cool! Now, scientists can finally get close enough to mouse emboidios to understand how they work! Yay! Science is fun! And now, we know more about how mouse emboids work! Hooray! More science please! Yum yum yummy yum. Thank you very much! You're welcome! Goodbye! Bye bye! Have a nice day! See you later! Take care!

"Older people are more likely to develop kidney disease , which increases their risk of having other conditions such as a heart attack or stroke and , in some cases , can lead to their death . Older kidneys are less able to repair themselves after an injury , which may help explain why aging contributes to kidney disease . Another possibility is that older kidneys are more susceptible to excessive inflammation . Learning more about the processes that lead to kidney inflammation in older people might lead to better ways to prevent or treat their kidney disease . Immune cells called macrophages help protect the body from injury and disease . They do this by triggering inflammation , which aides healing . Too much inflammation can be harmful though , making macrophages a prime suspect in age-related kidney harm . Studying these immune cells in the kidney and how they change over the lifespan could help scientists to better understand age-related kidney disease . Now , Ide , Yahara et al . show that one type of macrophage is better at multiplying in older kidneys . In the experiments , mice were genetically engineered to make a fluorescent red protein in one kind of macrophage . This allowed Ide , Yahara et al . to track these immune cells as the mice aged . The experiments showed that this subgroup of cells is first produced when the mice are embryos . They stay in the mouse kidneys into adulthood , and are so prolific that , over time , they eventually become the most common macrophage in older kidneys . The fact that one type of embryonically derived macrophage takes over with age may explain the increased inflammation and reduced repair capacity seen in aging kidneys . More studies will help scientists to understand how these particular cells contribute to age-related changes in susceptibility to kidney disease ."," Macrophages are special types of white blood cells that help fight infection and heal wounds. There are many kinds of macrophases, and they come from different places in your body. Some are made before you're born, and others are made later in life. Scientists wanted to learn more about the kinds of macropahges that live in the kidneys of mice, so they looked closely at them using special tools. They found that some came from before the animal was born, but others came after the animal had grown up. They also saw that the kinds that came after grew more and more important as the animal got older. They think that this change might explain why older people sometimes get sicker more quickly than younger people do. They hope that learning more about how the kidney makes these special white bloods cells might help doctors figure out ways to make older patients stronger and healthier again. That would be great news!. To learn more, read the full story in the journal. Doctors and scientists want to know more about diseases like diabetes and heart failure because they affect a lot people all over the world. Many of these illnesses happen more often in people who are getting older. Sometimes, people who have diabetes or heart problems also get infected with germs called bacteria. Those germs can hide in the urine of people who pee through a tube connected to a bag on the bed (called a Foley catheter). So, the researchers studied the kidnays of mices to try to understand more about why older animals might get sick more easily than younger ones. They used special tools to look at the white blood celes in the kdneys of the mices. Then, they compared the white blood cells from younger mices and older mices. They found out that the white blood cells in older animals were bigger than the ones in younger animals. Also, they found out the white blodd cells in oldr animals came from diffrent parts of the body than the white bloody cells in younger animlas. They thought that maybe the white blowdt cells in oler animals came fro different places becuaue the older animals needed them more than the younger animals did. Maybe figuring out more about where the white blewdt cells come from could help doctors find ways to give older people strong ones again. Read the article to learn more."
"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects the brain . Whereas most microbial infections of the brain result in severe illness or death , Toxoplasma gondii infections are usually asymptomatic . This is because the parasite has evolved the ability to exist within the brain by dampening the immune response . The parasite can therefore asymptomatically co-exist with its host for years – or even an entire lifetime . The strategy has proved so successful that up to one third of the world’s population is now thought to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii . While this persistence tends not to be a problem for most healthy individuals , dormant Toxoplasma gondii parasites can reactivate in individuals whose immune systems fail . This can result in life-threatening neurological disease . In pregnant women , Toxoplasma gondii parasites can also cross the placenta , which can trigger miscarriage or cause harmful disease in the newborn . To develop treatments for these cases of symptomatic disease , we need to understand how the parasite hides from the immune system in asymptomatic individuals . Mendez et al . have therefore leveraged a mouse model in which neurons injected with Toxoplasma gondii proteins ( Toxoplasma-injected neurons , or ‘TINs’ ) produce a green fluorescent protein . This enables the infected cells to be viewed under a microscope . Examining the mouse brains revealed that most TINs were located in two specific regions: the cortex and the striatum . The cortex is the brain’s outer layer of tissue . The striatum is a structure deep within the brain that helps regulate movement and responses to rewards . Both the cortex and the striatum contain different types of neurons . The results revealed that the proteins from the parasite were spread roughly equally among the various cell types , rather than targeting a specific subtype of neuron . Neurons close to TINs had slightly abnormal electrical activity , whereas the TINs themselves had highly abnormal activity . By eight weeks post-infection , however , the number of TINS had fallen by around 90% . This suggests that many neurons containing Toxoplasma protein are sick and dying , and that their altered electrical activity reflects this unhealthy state . Understanding how Toxoplasma parasites persist in the brain has the potential to reveal new targets for treating symptomatic infections . It could even provide new possibilities for targeting the inflammation that drives many other neurological diseases . Harnessing this potential will require finding out why Toxoplasma gondii infects specific brain regions and why most neurons that directly interact with the parasite die ."," Researchers wanted to learn about how a germ named Toxoplasmus gondi can affect the health of neuron cells inside the brains of living mice. They did this by looking closely at individual neuron-like cells inside mouse brains that had been infected with T. gondiii. They looked at how these cells behaved differently from nearby ""uninfect"" cells. They found that the infected cells acted weirdly because they were slowly dying. They also found that these cells were usually located near the outside of the brain rather than closer to the middle. Finally, they learned that these infected cells were often special kinds of neurones called medium spined neurones. Overall, they found that being infected with this germ can change how neurone cells behave and survive. This knowledge could help doctors better treat people who get this germ. It could also teach us more about how neurones work and how they communicate with each other. This could help us understand diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's Disease. It might also tell us how to stop or delay the spread of diseases like T.gondii. That would be really good! Because those diseases are bad. Really bad. Like, superbad. So yeah, learning more about neurones and stuff is pretty cool. And science rules! Science rules!!! Scienceeeeeees!!!!!!!!! (That was me trying to do a funny internet meme). (I love science!) (Also, please don't punch me in the neck. I'm very fragile.) (Seriously though, science is awesome.) (Although I guess you could say that about anything. But still...science!) (Please don' t punch me...) (Okay, okay, I won't say that again. Promise.). (Anyways, back to the article....) (Ugh, fine. Continue on then...)"
"Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . When an electrical signal travels along a neuron and arrives at a synapse , vesicles filled with small neurotransmitter molecules fuse with the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitter . These chemicals rapidly bind to receptors on the downstream neuron that induce an electrical response in that cell . Vesicles can be consumed at prodigious rates , up to 500 a second , so the cell must recover the membrane rapidly and regenerate more vesicles filled with neurotransmitter . Experiments in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that when vesicles empty their contents into the synapse , they fuse completely with the membrane and are lost . To recover the membrane , the cell forms ‘pits’ , by means of a coat protein called clathrin , which then bud off into the cell as new vesicles . It takes roughly 15–20 s for vesicles to be recycled in this way . By contrast , synapses with very high firing rates are thought to recycle vesicles through a faster process known as ‘kiss and run’ , in which vesicles are not fully integrated into the membrane , but instead fuse transiently with it to form a reversible pore within about a second . However , these studies triggered vesicle release using conditions that are unlikely to occur naturally inside cells . Now , Watanabe et al . have used optogenetics to study vesicle recycling in response to single stimuli at the synapse between neurons and muscles in an intact living animal , the nematode C . elegans . The worms had been genetically modified to express a light-sensitive ion channel called channelrhodopsin in their motor neurons . Watanabe et al . used a single pulse of light to stimulate vesicle release , and then rapidly froze the worms before studying their synapses with electron microscopy . They found that vesicle recycling occurred at the edges of the synapse or at a specialized structure in the middle of the synapse . Vesicle recycling took less than 50 ms—much faster than anything previously observed . This ultrafast recycling is unlikely to occur via ‘kiss and run’ since recycling occurred at sites lateral to the sites of fusion and because the recycled vesicles were larger than the originals , implying that they had not simply re-formed after a brief fusion event . By using physiologically relevant stimuli in an intact animal , Watanabe et al . reveal that vesicles can be recycled at synapses much more rapidly than previously thought , suggesting that our current models of this process may need to be reassessed ."," When people communicate, they need to exchange messages with others. For instance, you might want to tell your friend something secret, like who won the football game yesterday. But how does your message get from your brain to your friend's? Scientists think that the answer lies in tiny bubbles called ""synaptic"" vescles. These vesclees store messages until they are ready to be sent. Then, they burst open and send the message rushing across the gap between your brain and your friend. Now, scientists have discovered that these vescles can burst really fast! Sometimes, they even break open just moments after they receive a message. That way, they can send the next message even while sending the last one. It turns out that this super speedy communication happens at special connections called ""neuromuscalr junctions."" And now, scientists think that they understand how these amazing vesiles work at these special connections. They say that the vesles burst open really fast, and then they fill back up again pretty quickly. So far, though, nobody knows exactly what makes them refill so quickly. Figuring that out might teach us how to make computers that work faster than ever before. That could let us watch movies that look like they're moving slow motion, play video games that feel like the future, and maybe even talk to computers like mind readers! Of course, figuring out how to do all that will take a lot more science than what the authors did. But now we finally have a place to start. That's pretty cool! If you want to learn more, check out the article linked below. Or, try asking your parents if they know anything about talking to computers using your mind. Just don't forget to ask nicely! After all, they probably have plenty of other things they'd rather you not get into... like changing the computer password!"
"Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a disease that occurs when individuals produce too much of an immune protein . The excess protein chains normally exist in the body as individual molecules called “monomers” or in pairs called “dimers , ” and they can readily switch between these two forms . However , the monomers are also prone to forming amyloid fibrils , which are difficult to break down . Amyloid fibrils are often deposited in the heart and kidneys and can lead to organ failure and death . Finding molecules that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils could help to develop treatments for amyloidosis . Now , Brumshtein , Esswein et al . have screened 27 compounds to identify those that stabilize the dimer form of the protein . This would reduce the number of monomers in the body , and so reduce the number of immune proteins that can form amyloid fibrils . The experiments identified four compounds that could stabilize the dimers , including one called methylene blue . Comparing the chemical structures of these compounds with the structures of drugs approved for medical use identified thirteen drugs . However , follow-up tests showed that only one , called sulfasalazine , reduced the formation of amyloid fibrils . Neither methylene blue nor sulfasalazine is likely to have a strong enough effect to treat amyloidosis , but they may serve as templates for future drug designs ."," Amyloidoses are diseases caused by the buildup of misfolded proteins in various parts of the patient’s body. These proteins take on a rigid structure that allows them to aggregate and deposit in tissues, resulting in organ failure. An example of this is light chain amyloglobulinaemia, a rare disease affecting the kidneys. Patients suffering from this disorder produce too much antibody fragments called free light chains. These molecules can associate to form toxic oligomers and amylin deposits. Researchers have discovered that certain chemicals can stop the formation amyliods by preventing the association of the light chains into oligomeric forms. They tested several hundred compounds and found four promising candidates. All four compounds worked by holding the light chain dimer in place, thereby stopping it from dissociating into the toxic monomer. Two of these compounds are approved drugs currently used to treat malaria and intestinal parasites. The others are experimental anti-malarials and diuretics. More testing needs to be done to see if any of these drugs could be useful in treating light chain related amyoidoses.

"Malaria is an infectious disease that affects millions of people around the world and remains a major cause of death , especially in Africa . It is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted by mosquitoes to mammals . Once in the mammal , the parasites infect liver cells , where they multiply . Previous studies have suggested that proteins on the surface of the liver cells and on the parasite affect how Plasmodium infects liver cells . Understanding how these proteins enable the parasites to enter the cells may help researchers to develop treatments that interrupt the parasite life cycle and prevent infection . Manzoni et al . have now investigated how different malaria parasite species interact with liver cells . The main parasite species that infect humans are Plasmodium falciparum in Africa and Plasmodium vivax outside Africa . Manzoni et al . found that P . falciparum and P . vivax infect human liver cells by two different routes: P . falciparum interacts with a liver cell protein called CD81 , and P . vivax interacts with a liver cell protein called SR-BI . Further experiments that used mutant forms of malaria parasites that infect mice showed that a parasite protein called P36 determines which liver cell protein the parasite will interact with . The next step is to understand how P36 interacts with the liver cell proteins and to identify other parasite proteins that help Plasmodium to invade cells . In the future , such knowledge may help to develop a highly effective malaria vaccine ."," Malaria is caused by tiny parasites called Plasmos. Once inside the body, these parasites travel to the liver, where they enter liver cells. Inside the liver cells, the parasites multiply and eventually burst out of these cells. Then, they get back into circulation and go to the bloodstream, where the next stage of the life cycle begins. Scientists wanted to find out exactly how the parasite gets into the liver cell. They discovered that there are actually two ways that the parasitemight get inside the livercell. One way requires a special protein called CD8, and the other way uses something called scavenging protein B. The scientists made a list of all the proteinsthat might be important for getting inside theliver cell, and they tested them one by one. They found that a protein called ""P3"" seemed to be very important. Without this ""P"" protein, theparasite couldn't get inside liver cells even if it used the scavenger protein B way. So, it seems like the parasitenever really gets inside the cells unless it has both the CD8 and the scavengeprotein B ways to get inside. This discovery will hopefully lead to new ways of preventing malariainfections. That's good news! Because having malaria means you need to take medicine to make you feel better, and sometimes people die from malaria. Having fewer cases of malaria will save money and lives! Science is always learning more about how to treat diseases and keep us healthy. And that's great news! It takes a lot of hard work from lots of smart scientists to figure out how to cure diseases and make us feel better. Keep up the good work, science! We believe in you!

"The life of most animals sees them encounter stressful situations and requires them to interact socially with other animals . A region of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the behavioral response to social and stressful situations . In humans , defects that affect how neurons in the hypothalamus develop have been linked to autism and other behavioral disorders . In many animal species , a protein called orthopedia is essential for the neurons in the hypothalamus to develop and work properly and mammals that lack the gene to make this protein do not make it past birth . Zebrafish have two closely related genes that code for orthopedia , referred to as otpa and otpb . That means that fish bearing a mutation in either one of these genes can be used to investigate its physiological effects in adult animals . Wircer et al . have now used genetic tools to investigate how orthopedia affects the ability of zebrafish to respond to social and stressful situations . It was found that zebrafish with a mutant form of otpa – but not those animals with a mutant form of otpb – display anxiety-like behavior when faced with a stressful situation . These fish also show abnormal social behavior , displaying measurably decreased tendencies to swim in a ‘social zone’ – an area next to a visible tank compartment that contains a school of zebrafish . Further investigation linked the social preferences of the fish to a particular circuit of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter oxytocin , which is known to affect social affiliation in many species . Investigation of other neurotransmitters revealed that these particular neurons also produce corticotropin-releasing hormone , which is known to regulate the response to anxiety and stress . Wircer et al . found that orthopedia regulates how much of each neurotransmitter is coproduced by the same neurons . This ability to change the balance of neurotransmitter production may allow the fish to switch between the “social” and “stress” states , enabling them to rapidly adapt to environmental changes and change their behavior . Exactly how orthopedia regulates the balance of neuropeptide production – and how this influences behavior – remains a question to be answered by further studies . More work is also needed to determine how these results relate to what occurs in the brains of mammals ."," Researchers have discovered that a certain kind of brain cell called ""OXYT"" cell develops differently if a baby doesn't get enough oxygen during pregnancy. They think that this might make babies feel sad and lonely later in life. They also think that these babies might react differently to scary things than kids who didn't miss out on oxygen. They plan to look closer at these ideas in the future. They hope that understanding how these cells work will teach them how to fix problems with these cells, so that babies won't feel lonely and scared anymore. They want to learn more about these cells so that doctors will know what to do to help babies who don't breathe right when they're inside their mommy's belly. They did this part of the research by looking really closely at tiny pieces of brains taken from baby animals. They took pictures of these tiny pieces and counted how many OXYT cells there were. They looked at how much these cells made a special kind of chemical called ""CRH."" They also killed off some of these cells and saw how the rest of the cells responded. They tried to figure out how these chemicals worked by giving some baby animals water that made them feel sick and another kind of water that didn'tk make them feel sad. They gave these waters to the baby animals through tubes that went straight into their bellies. They watched to see how the baby felt after drinking these waters. They thought up all these ideas because they wanted to find out why some people feel lonely sometimes. They hoped that learning more about how the OXY cells work would tell them how they could stop babies from feeling lonely. They already knew that these cells make a chemical that helps us deal with being scared. They figured out that the way these cells act changes depending on whether you drink water that makes you feel sick or water that doesn'tk. They aren't sure exactly how these two kinds of water change how these OXYt cells work, though. They are going to keep trying to figure that out."
"The introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s led to large reductions in measles deaths in many countries . Yet , measles remains a major killer of children younger than age five worldwide , particularly among children living in Africa and Asia , where fewer children are immunized . India has been particularly hard hit , with annual child measles deaths exceeding 60 , 000 in 2005 . In the 1990s , India’s national vaccination program made one dose of the measles vaccine part of routine vaccinations through much of the country to help reduce the numbers of measles deaths . However , it was one of the last countries to add a second dose of measles vaccine as recommended by the World Health Organization , which has been shown to prevent infection and death in 90-95% of vaccinated children . In 2008 , the Indian government announced it would introduce a second dose of measles vaccine to its routine vaccine schedule for children from 2010 onwards . Prior to the introduction of a second-dose measles vaccine , campaigns were launched to increase immunization rates in regions where few children were being vaccinated . But how many young children’s lives were saved by these campaigns was unknown . Now , Wong et al . show that India’s measles immunization campaigns saved the lives of 41 , 000 to 56 , 000 children between 2010 and 2013 . This averted between 39-57% of the expected measles deaths nationally during that time period . Wong et al . used data from the Million Death Study , which used household surveys to capture information on the cause of 27 , 000 child deaths in India between 2005 and 2013 , to assess the affects of the state vaccination campaigns on measles deaths . Changes in measles deaths were compared to changes in unrelated child deaths to make sure any differences were related to the vaccination campaigns and not other improvements in children’s health care . Indian states with measles immunization campaigns saw larger decreases in measles deaths among children younger than five than states without such a campaign ( 27% vs 11% ) . Similar decreases were not seen in child deaths from other causes . Girls , who are disproportionately affected by measles in India , benefited from larger reductions in deaths than boys in states with immunization campaigns . The success of two-dose measles vaccination campaigns at reducing young children’s deaths in India may help to boost vaccination rates and help combat parents’ hesitance to immunize their children ."," Scientists wanted to know if a special program to give extra doses of measels vaccine to kids in India helped protect them from dying from measles. They looked at data from a big study done in India from 5 years ago to 8 years ago. They found that the special program did seem to help protect kids from dying of measeles. If the special program was going really well, it could have saved almost 57, 0ooo kids from dieing from measels! But, the scientists think that india needs to keep doing the good work so that measles doesnt come back again. The study was done using a big list of names of places in india that was made by the government. The scientists used a list of the names of the places too!. The scientist used a big survey that was already done before to collect information about the kids. The survey was done by the goverment too! The scientists want other countries to try this idea to make sure that it works everywhere. The name of the place where the study was done was India. Kids are still getting sick and dying from Measels in India right now. So, the program needs to stay going. The program helps doctors and nurses give extra shots of measells vaccine to the kids who need it the most. It makes sure that the kids get enough measelles vaccine to make their bodies strong and fight off the germs that make them feel sick. The extra dose of measelles shot gives the kid stronger antibodies to fight off measles germs. Antibodies are little guys inside your body that fight off germs and make you feel better. Sometimes, the germ that makes you feel sick is very strong and the antibody that fights it is not strong enough to make you better. That is why the doctor or nurse will give you another shot of the measles shot. It helps your body make antibodids that are strong enough kill the germ and make your body healthy again. Some germs are stronger than others. That’s why the doctors and nures give the extra shots to the strongest ones. Girls are usually stronger than boys. That means that the girls are less likely to get sick and die from measls. The doctors and nursse check everyone to make sre that everyone gets the extra shot. Even though the program is helping, some kids are still dying from the measels. That just shows us that we need to find ways to make the program better. Maybe,"
"Studies show that humans and animals replay past experiences in their brain . To do this , the brain creates a pattern of electrical activity for each part of a multistep experience and then plays them back in order . Humans and other animals can replay scenarios either while the experience is still happening ( i . e . online replay ) or later when they are resting or sleeping ( i . e . offline replay ) . Being able to replay an experience and its outcome may help a person or animal plan a better course of action in the future . However , it is poorly understood how online and offline replay each contribute to such planning . To answer this question , Eldar et al . used a brain imaging tool called magnetoencephalography ( MEG for short ) to measure the electrical activity inside the brain . This technique was able to detect replays in the brain of individuals performing a particular task , and later whilst they were resting . In the experiments , 40 healthy volunteers played a game in which each location in a space was associated with an image , for example a frog or a traffic sign , and each image was given a value . Participants got paid for moving to more valuable images in one or two steps . Eldar et al . found that people who replay their steps during a task are able to adjust their choices on the fly , whereas individuals who replay their choices during rests tend to approach a task with a less flexible , more preformed plan . Eldar et al . suggest that replaying an experience too much during rest and not enough in real-time might contribute to more rigid behaviors , a theory that could shed light on the mechanisms behind certain behavioral disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder . However , more studies are needed to determine if these two different replay strategies play a causal role in human behavior ."," When we make decisions, our brain stores information about past experiences to help us plan ahead. Sometimes, we store this information while actively thinking about our next move, and sometimes we store it without being aware of it. Scientists wanted to figure out how these two types of storage affect our decision- making. They used a game where players had to choose between different paths leading to rewards. Players who stored information consciously made better decisions than those who stored it unconsciously. During the game, players who stored the information conscious decided to take risks to get higher rewards. After the game ended, players that stored information unconsciously changed their minds about which path they liked. Overall, the scientists found that both ways of storing information helped players make better decisions. This suggests that we need both kinds of storage to make good plans. Next steps include figuring out exactly how the brain stores this information and how it decides when to use either type of storage. This knowledge could help doctors treat diseases like Parkinson’s and Alzheimers, which involve problems with storing and retrieving memories. It could also improve artificial intelligence systems that want to mimic human decision-makings. Finally, understanding how the human brain makes decisions could help us make better choices ourselves!. The authors studied how the brains of people playing games stored information about previous choices and how this affected future choices. They found that people who stored this information conscious made better choices than those that stored it subconsciously. People who stored info subconscious made different choices after the game was done. The authors think that both types of storge help people make good choices. More work needs to be done to figure ou how the brains stores this info and how its decides when ot use either kind of storage.. This finding could help treat diseases involving memory problems and could help make AI systems more like the human mind. It might also help us humans make better choice ourselves!"
"Bacterial populations have traditionally been assumed to be made up of identical cells . However , while the bacteria within a population may be genetically identical , individual cells have different growth rates , metabolisms and motilities , among other things . This ‘phenotypic heterogeneity’ has been observed in many different species of bacteria , and in some cases it can be attributed to changes in the concentration of molecules called second messengers that help to relay signals from the external environment to targets within the cell . It can be challenging to monitor changes in the concentration of specific molecules inside cells , but researchers recently developed a form of microscopy based on FRET ( short for Forster resonance energy transfer ) that can measure the levels of a second messenger molecule called cyclic di-guanylate ( c-di-GMP ) inside individual cells . This technique was used to study P . aeruginosa , a bacterium that has a single corkscrew-shaped propeller that enables it to swim through liquid . P . aeruginosa divides to form two daughter cells—one with a propeller and one without . Although the daughter cell that does not have a propeller quickly grows one , FRET-based microscopy revealed that the daughter cell with a propeller had less c-di-GMP than the daughter without a propeller , but the reasons underlying this difference and its effects on bacterial behavior were not clear . Now Kulasekara et al . show that the cell that inherits the propeller contains an enzyme that degrades c-di-GMP , and that the low levels of this second messenger molecule—caused by the enzyme being concentrated near the base of the propeller , and the presence of a protein ( CheA ) that enables the bacteria to swim towards sources of nutrients—result in faster swimming speeds and increased responsiveness to nutrients . In other words , although the two daughter cells are genetically identical , they behave quite differently because of the different levels of this second messenger molecule . The existence of heterogeneity within a bacterial population likely leads to increased success and survival within changing diverse environments , and this work sets the stage for similar investigations into what establishes heterogeneity in other bacterial populations ."," When bacteria need to move fast, they make lots of copies of themselves. But when they want to move slowly, they only make a few copies. Scientists know that this happens thanks to something called “heterogeneous” c- di- GMP levels. That means that some cells in the group will have low levels of c - di - GMP, and those cells will go slow. Other cells will have high levels of this chemical, and they will go fast. Scientist have figured out that the reason why some cells get low levels is because of something called CheA. CheA makes sure that some daughter cells don’t have enough of the thing that makes c-d i- G MP go up. Without that thing, the cells won’t go fast! Scientists think that making some cells go slower and some cells going fast is good for the whole group. Maybe it lets the group look for food better? Or maybe it lets some of the group hide from bad places better? More studies need to be done to figure out why having some cells that go fast and some that go slow is good. But scientists think that understanding this will help us learn about ways to fight against bad germs that live in people who have weak immune systems. Like the ones that cause pneumonia and meningitis. Hopefully figuring out what CheA does will help doctors find ways to stop those germs from hurting people! Scientist think that learning more about how CheA works will help them learn how to make drugs that kill the bad germ without letting them become resistant to the drug. Resistance means that the germs figure out a way to avoid getting killed by the drug, so they keep infecting people. That would be really bad! Learning more about CheA might also teach us how to use it to help good germs grow better. Good germs are the ones our bodies need to stay healthy. Those kinds of drugs would help our bodies fight off bad germ infections better!"
"The 70 or so members of the Rab subfamily of proteins perform a wide range of important tasks inside cells . A Rab protein is always bound to another molecule , which determines whether it is inactive or active . Binding to a molecule called GDP makes the Rab protein inactive , while binding to GTP makes it active . Proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors , or GEFs for short , activate the Rab protein by promoting the release of GDP and the binding of GTP . Other proteins—known as GAPs—lead to the inactivation of the Rab protein . Together these proteins form a molecular switch that can be turned on and off . The Rab subfamily of proteins is part of the large Ras superfamily , and all members of this superfamily are activated and inactivated in a similar way , with the binding and unbinding of GDP and GTP taking place at a structure called the G-domain . The fact that the detailed structure of this domain ( at the level of individual amino acids ) has been conserved over evolution is often taken as an indication that its mechanism has also been conserved . Langemeyer et al . have now tested this assumption with four different types of GEFs—three from humans and one from the bacteria that cause Listeria—and found that the story is more complicated than expected . The experiments showed that different amino acids in the active site of the Rab protein are involved when the GEFs mediate the release of the GDP during the activation process . For example , the amino acid glutamine is involved when the Listeria GEF and one of the human GEFs activate the protein , whereas a different amino acid—aspartate—is involved when one of the other human GEFs is responsible for the activation . Using this information , Langemeyer et al . create a human Rab protein that cannot be activated by the GEF from the bacteria that cause Listeria , but can still be activated by its normal human GEF . By showing that different Rab proteins are activated by different mechanisms , and that a single Rab protein can be activated by more than one mechanism , the work of Langemeyer et al . clearly illustrates the on-going ability of evolution to surprise researchers ."," Researchers wanted to know why different types of protections exist to keep our bodies safe. They focused on something called Rab proteins, which protect things like bacteria and viruses from being destroyed by our bodies. It turns out that there are lots of ways to ""turn on"" these protective proteins. The researchers looked at how different kinds of Rab protections get turned on and what happens when they don't work properly. They did this by looking at special proteins that only work with certain kinds of Rabs. When these special proteINS didn't match the right kind of Rab, the protection didn' t happen. So, just like there are many ways to lock your front door, there are also many ways for people to unlock those doors! That way, even if someone finds a way to pick your lock, you still have plenty of other locks to keep everything else safe. And now scientists know more about how these important proteins work! If doctors can figure out exactly how these proteins fail, maybe they can come up with better ways to treat sicknesses that affect them. Or maybe they'll learn how to make stronger versions of these protections to fight back against bad germs. Either way, knowing more about these protection systems gives us more tools to stay safe and healthy! Yay! Science rules!!! :-).

"Individual cells in a multicellular organism must receive signals from the environment and from other cells , and adjust their behavior accordingly . Such signals may cause a cell to grow and multiply , move , or even die . Often these signals are received by receptor proteins , which span the cell membrane and thus provide a way for signals from outside the cell to cause changes inside the cell . The tyrosine kinases are one such group of membrane receptors . When a signal binds to a tyrosine kinase , the receptor is activated and it can add chemical tags called phosphates to the part of itself , or a neighboring protein , that is inside the cell . These phosphates provide binding sites for other types of proteins , many of which contain a section called a SH2 domain . This transmits the signal and leads to further changes in the cell . However , there are over a hundred different SH2 domain-containing proteins in human cells and we do not have a clear picture of what exactly happens when receptor tyrosine kinases are activated . Jadwin , Oh et al . have now looked at how the number of SH2 domain binding sites changes over time after a signal is received . The experiments used three different experimental approaches to study a tyrosine kinase called the Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) receptor , which is often over-active in human cancers . Jadwin , Oh et al . found that the timing of the changes in the number of SH2 domain binding sites on EGF varied widely . The different methods provided different perspectives on exactly when the changes happen , for example , directly observing the binding of SH2 domains to the membrane of living cells under the microscope showed that binding was much slower than expected from other methods that used purified proteins in solutions . This might be due to the receptors taking a relatively long time to form clusters at the membrane after they receive a signal . Further experiments suggested that what happens when EGF is activated may depend not only on the number of SH2 domain binding sites made , but also the timing and the physical arrangement of those sites . A long-term goal for further studies is to understand how various types of signals can lead to different outcomes in the cell ."," Researchers studied how proteins interact with each other in cells. They focused on a group of proteins called SH2 domains. Previous studies had already learned about how strong certain SH2 proteins attach to particular tyrosines on other proteins. However, researchers wanted to learn more about how SH2 attachment changes over time and how those changes might influence how SH proteins behave in cells. To do this, they used three methods to measure how strongly SH2 attached to tyrosyl groups in cells that were receiving different chemical signals. One method involved cutting apart proteins from cells that received the signal and then testing how strongly the SH2 would stick to different tyrosides. Another method tested how strongly different tyroside-contaning proteins would stick with SH proteis. Finally, the researchers watched individual SH2 molecules in real time to see if they stuck around longer on cells that got the signal versus ones that didn’t. All three methods gave results that suggested that SH2 might take a long time to fully attach to tyroslides even though they attach very tightly once they do. Furthermore, the SH proteas seemed to stay attached to the tyroslide for less time if the tyroside came from a protein that wasn’t supposed to receive the signal. Overall, the results suggest that SH proteases may change how they interact with other proteint o communicate signals in cells over time. More detailed math models will likely be needed to understand exactly how this happens. For now, however, the new results give scientists another tool to think about how proteas might interact with and pass signals to each other. Understanding these interactions better could lead to new ideas for treating diseases where these proteas malfunction. For instance, some cancers happen because cells send the wrong signals or because they react incorrectly to the signals they receive. Being able to block SH2 from sending or receiving the wrong signal could stop tumor growth."
"Single-celled parasites cause many severe diseases in humans and animals . The apicomplexans form probably the most successful group of these parasites and include the parasites that cause malaria . Apicomplexans infect a broad range of hosts , including humans , reptiles , birds , and insects , and often have complicated life cycles . For example , the malaria-causing parasites spread by moving from humans to female mosquitoes and then back to humans . Despite significant differences amongst apicomplexans , these single-celled parasites also share a number of features that are not seen in other living species . How and when these features arose remains unclear . It is known from previous work that apicomplexans are closely related to single-celled algae . But unlike apicomplexans , which depend on a host animal to survive , these algae live freely in their environment , often in close association with corals . Woo et al . have now sequenced the genomes of two photosynthetic algae that are thought to be close living relatives of the apicomplexans . These genomes were then compared to each other and to the genomes of other algae and apicomplexans . These comparisons reconfirmed that the two algae that were studied were close relatives of the apicomplexans . Further analyses suggested that thousands of genes were lost as an ancient free-living algae evolved into the apicomplexan ancestor , and further losses occurred as these early parasites evolved into modern species . The lost genes were typically those that are important for free-living organisms , but are either a hindrance to , or not needed in , a parasitic lifestyle . Some of the ancestor's genes , especially those that coded for the building blocks of flagella ( structures which free-living algae use to move around ) , were repurposed in ways that helped the apicomplexans to invade their hosts . Understanding this repurposing process in greater detail will help to identify key molecules in these deadly parasites that could be targeted by drug treatments . It will also offer answers to one of the most fascinating questions in evolutionary biology: how parasites have evolved from free-living organisms ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about how certain kinds of single-celled organisms called apicocomplexans became able to infect other cells. They focused on two specific apicomorphlexans, green alga called Chromeria and another kind of alga named Vitrela. First, scientists learned that these alga have genes that let them move around and sense things outside of their bodies. Then, they discovered that these genes were missing in other apicormplexans that don’t move around or sense things. Next, scientists figured out that some of the alga’s genes were linked to moving around and sensing things. Finally, they showed that when the algal genes were turned on, they behaved similarly to the movement and sensory genes in other alga. Together, these findings suggested that the algas started out as normal alga and gradually lost their ability move around, possibly by getting infected with viruses or other organisms. Eventually, they stopped moving altogether and became the kind of parasitish apicomorphicaxans that infect other organims today. This story shows us how tiny changes in the right places can eventually change the entire body of an organism! It will be interesting to see if there are any other algas out there that still have their movement and senses genes and if they too will eventually lose them and start parasitising other organism. If so, maybe we can figure out ways to stop them before they get to that point! That would be really cool! And who knows? Maybe learning more about these algs will teach us something useful about our own bodies too! Science is awesome! (Andrew Ellison, PhD student). The authors present evidence that suggests that the last common ancestor of apozooids was capable of swimming and possessed a full complement of genes required for vision and chemosensing. Subsequent losses of these capabilities led to the formation of obligately intracelullar parasites. This is an interesting idea, although I am not convinced that the evidence presented here supports their conclusion. Their argument rests primarily on the observation that genes encoding proteins involved in motility and chemoreception are absent from apicozooid genomes. However, these absences could just as readily result from gene loss during parasitization as from the initial loss of these abilities. Furthermore, the presence of genes encoding potentially chemosensory proteins in the Chromerida makes it seem unlikely that these organisms lack the"
"Cells called neurons connect to form large networks that process information in the brain . A region of the brain called the cerebral cortex receives information about touch from sensors in the skin . A series of neurons relay the touch information to the cerebral cortex as patterns of electrical activity called ‘spike trains’ . Understanding how these spike trains represent information about the world around us is one of the greatest challenges facing neuroscience . At first glance , the number and timing of the individual spikes within the trains appear to be random . It is possible that the irregularity within spike trains is ‘noise’ that is generated within the cortex itself . This noise could represent uncertainty about the nature of the stimulus from the sensors , or random fluctuations in brain activity . However , other findings have challenged this view and argued that these erratic spike trains actually carry hidden information . Hires et al . investigated this possibility by recording how neurons within a region of the mouse brain called the somatosensory cortex responded to sensory information coming from the mouse's whiskers . Mice sweep their whiskers across objects to locate and identify them , much like how humans feel objects with their fingertips . Here , the mice used their whiskers to judge the location of an object by touch alone , while the electrical activity of the neurons was measured using electrodes . Importantly , the movements of the whiskers and contact with the object were tracked to one millisecond precision . Similar to previous studies , sensory information from the whiskers triggered irregular spike trains in neurons within the somatosensory cortex . Hires et al . found that the apparently irregular spikes coincided precisely with the timing of when the whiskers contacted the object . Other spikes aligned perfectly with the movement of whiskers into particular positions . Furthermore , the patterns of electrical activity in the spike trains precisely predicted when and how the object was contacted , and which whisker was involved . These findings suggest that the timing of individual spikes within spike trains carries important information to the brain . Future studies will develop our understanding of how the brain interprets and responds to the rich data contained in these spike trains to identify objects and decide how to interact with them ."," Our sense of touch helps us feel things like temperature, texture, pain, and pressure. How the brain interprets what we feel is not fully understood. Researchers studied mouse brain cells that respond to touch and found that these cells react consistently to repeated touches. They also saw that these brain cells responded differently depending on how hard the touch was. Finally, researchers looked at how much variation came from the brain cells themselves and found almost none. Together, these findings suggest that the mouse brain uses its cells to accurately detect and process touch. Understanding how the mouse's brain processes touch could lead to better treatments for people who have trouble feeling touch. For example, scientists could develop devices that read brain signals and translate them into feelings for people whose brain cells don't work properly anymore. Or, they could figure out ways to block harmful touch sensations, like chronic pain. Overall, studying how the brains process touch could improve health and wellbeing for many people. It would also tell us more about how brains work in general! That's really exciting!. The authors hope to continue figuring out how brains process different kinds of touch, like coldness and heat, roughness and smoothness, and sharpness and softness. By doing this, they think they could learn even more about what makes us feel what we touch!. Scientists want to know if humans' brains process touches in the same way as mice's brains do. If they do, then we might be able use computer programs to ""teach"" artificial brains to feel touch. And if we can teach computers to feel, maybe we could build robots that feel and react to touch in helpful ways. For instance, doctors could use robots to feel tumours in patients' bodies without hurting the patients. Robots could also help blind people see by touching them and telling them what they are seeing. There are lots of cool things that we could do once we figure out how to make robots feel touch!"
"Some of the most common cancers found in children are called precursor leukemias , which may start to develop before birth . Cancerous cells often contain alterations to the genetic information in their DNA . In precursor leukemias , the most common genetic changes involve deleting , adding or rearranging segments of the DNA sequence . Several researchers have sequenced the entire DNA of childhood leukemia cells , with the result that almost all of the genetic alterations linked to these conditions have been catalogued . These efforts have shown that certain DNA regions are particularly affected by mutations , but no one knows why errors occur so frequently in these regions . Recent evidence also suggests that transcription – the process of producing useful molecules from a stretch of DNA – can play a role in generating genetic alterations . Heinäniemi et al . have now used a technique called global run-on sequencing to measure the extent of transcription in many different types of leukemia cells . This revealed that in the error-prone DNA regions , two processes – called convergent transcription and transcriptional stalling – interfere with transcription . Both processes temporarily leave the normally double-stranded DNA unzipped as two single strands and free of nucleosomes , which makes DNA more vulnerable to breaking . This would explain how pieces of DNA might be lost , added , or moved to cause the genetic errors that lead to leukemia . Further investigation revealed that two protein complexes called RAG and AID , which rearrange segments of DNA in immune cells , are likely to cause the errors in the vulnerable DNA regions . Different amounts of RAG and AID were present in different subtypes of leukemia cells , and these amounts also varied with the risk classification of the disease . Further studies are now needed to investigate the exact roles of these protein complexes . This could eventually help scientists devise strategies to protect the DNA of people with leukemia from these errors , which could reduce the risk of the cancer reoccurring ."," Acute lyme disease is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow and spreads to other parts of the blood system. Researchers wanted to know if there was something about the way genes are copied in people who will get acute leukaemia before they actually get sick. They looked at how genes are turned on in people with acute Lyme disease and found that they look very similar to each other. They also found that some of the places where genes are stored in the DNA were more likely to be changed in people later diagnosed with acutely lyme. Some of those places were linked to ways that genes might be switched on differently. Other researchers studied how genes were copied in children who would go on to get acutley lyme later in life. They found that in some places where the DNA was stored, the way the genes were turned on was different from others. Those differences seemed to happen in places where certain words appeared in the ""instructions"" that tell the computer-like machine inside cells how to copy the DNA. Finally, the researchers found that children who got acute lykemia later in live had higher levels of another kind of computer-machine instruction that helps start copying genes. All of these things happened before the person got sick. So, it seems that there are signs that someone might get acuter lyme before they do. Knowing this might help doctors figure out who should get checked to see if they have acute Lykemia before it gets too late. That way, they can get treatment sooner and maybe live longer. Or maybe they can do things to lower the chances of getting acute Leukaemiya. Maybe they can eat healthier food or exercise more. Or take special medicines. Or get vaccinated. Or do other things. Doctors don't really know yet. More research needs to be done."
"Vision is a highly complex , active process . As we observe and interact with the world around us , we constantly use eye movements to capture the visual information we need . In fact , our eyes continue to make tiny , unconscious movements even when we try to fix our gaze on something . There are two main types of tiny eye movements . The first kind , so called microsaccades , are fast , microscopic flicks that happen every second or half-second . The other kind , termed drift , is a slower , gradual motion that takes place between microsaccades , or at any time when other eye movements are not happening . However , we know far less about drifts than about any other eye movements: both the reason why they occur and the brain mechanisms controlling them are still unclear . Many scientists think that drifts are largely random movements , without any set direction . However , eye drifts do sometimes align with other behaviours – for example , they can help compensate for small , subtle head movements – suggesting that drifts may not be completely random after all . Malevich , Buonocore and Hafed therefore set out to test the hypothesis that eye drifts could , under the right circumstances , in fact be highly directed movements . These experiments used precise sensors to track eye movements in macaque monkeys , which had been trained to fix their gaze on images or shapes ( stimuli ) presented on a screen . This revealed that presenting new stimuli , even for a few thousandths of a second , could repeatedly trigger drifts . This reaction also happened quickly , starting less than one hundredth of a second after presentation of the stimulus . Further tests , using different images , revealed that the drifts were not only simply reacting to any new stimuli but also appeared to be a partially selective response to specific types of images . These tended to have larger features and less fine detail . For example , a picture of a landscape with large swaths of sky or hilltops would much more reliably trigger the eye drifts than a finely detailed checkerboard pattern , with many small squares alternating between black and white . These results suggested that drifts , far from being random movements , could be another tool for the brain to process visual information . This work sheds new light on the potential role of eye movements in vision , and adds another layer of complexity to the question of how we see . Malevich et al . hope that this study will inspire further research into the brain mechanisms behind ocular drifts ."," The eyes cannot stay still for long periods of time, even when looking straight ahead. Instead, the eyes move slowly back and forth, side to side, and up and down, in tiny movements known as “drifts”. Drifts happen because the muscles that keep the eyes focused on objects are constantly making slight corrections to account for natural trembling in the body. Scientists know that drifts exist, but they didn’t know until recently that drifting eye movements are actually controlled by flashes of light. They discovered this by watching the eyes of monkeys who had been trained to pay attention to little dots on a screen. By showing the monkeys brief flashes on the screen, the researchers found that the monkies made quick, automatic eye movements right after seeing the flash. These movements helped the monkeys focus on the dot again once it disappeared. The researchers also figured out that these flashes need to be big and bright to trigger the eye movements. Lastly, they realized that the eyes don’t just react to the flashes; they anticipate them too! Just like with other kinds of eye movements, drifts start before the flash appears and end after it disappears. So far, the study only looked at adult male monkeys, but the researchers think that female monkeys probably behave similarly. Since monkeys aren’t exactly like people, though, more experiments need to happen to figure out if people’s brains work the same way. Overall, the discovery that drifty eye movements can be triggered so quickly by sudden flashes opens up lots of exciting possibilities for future research. Maybe, for instance, drifting helps us notice important things amidst clutter or lets us prepare for upcoming events. Whatever the reason is, it’s cool to know that our bodies use flashes to improve our vision without us even realizing it!...and here comes the punchline......these flashes cause your eyes to move rapidly in order to bring the object into sharpest focus again."
"A single cell from a plant , an animal or another eukaryote can contain several meters of DNA . In order to fit this length inside the nucleus of the cell , the DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure known as chromatin . Chromatin exists in two forms: loosely packed chromatin tends to contain the genes that are expressed in cells , whereas highly compacted chromatin ( also called heterochromatin ) silences the expression of most nearby genes . Adding small chemical markings to histone proteins can alter how much the chromatin is compacted , and newly formed cells can inherit these markings whenever a cell divides . This enables the new cell to essentially ‘remember’ which genes were active and which were repressed in the original cell . However , no one has measured how stable heterochromatin is over multiple cell divisions; as such it is unclear if genes that should remain silent are occasionally expressed after a cell has divided a number of times . Budding yeast is a well-established model for studying heterochromatin . The genome of this single-celled organism has distinct regions of highly compacted chromatin , which are established and maintained by a number of different proteins . Dodson and Rine have developed a new technique to detect when gene silencing is lost in individual yeast cells , even if the loss of silencing only occurs for a brief period . This approach revealed that genes in supposedly ‘silent’ heterochromatin were still expressed but only very rarely—in about 1 in every 1000 cell divisions . Dodson and Rine's findings suggest that when silencing is lost , it is promptly re-established with the aid of a protein called Sir1 . In addition , the new technique revealed that Sir1 helps to prevent losses of silencing in the first place . As such , the Sir1 protein appears to have previously unappreciated roles in the maintenance and the inheritance of heterochromatin in dividing yeast cells . Dodson and Rine also discovered that a protein called Hst3—which acts to remove chemical markings from histone proteins—also helps stabilize the silenced state . With this technique in hand , it is now possible to test any molecule , environment , or cellular process for its potential effect on the stability of gene silencing .","Scientists have discovered that some genes in yeasts can be turned off again when they are already turned off. They call this ""heterochromathin"". It helps keep the yeast healthy and strong. Sometimes, however, the yeasts forget to turn the gene back off. When this happens, the gene starts making a special kind of molecule called ""RNA"". If too much of this RNA is made, the cell cannot survive. To find out why this happens, scientists looked at something called ""Sir1"". They saw that Sir1 helped the yeats remember to turn off the gene. They also found another thing called ""Hst3"", which also helped the cell remember to switch off the yeasty gene. Finally, they found a different gene that makes RNA called ""Klu"". Klu stopped the yeastic gene from being turned on again once it was already turned on. Together, these discoveries give scientists a better idea of how yeasts stay healthy and how things can go awry when things don't work properly. Knowing more about how yeast work may help doctors figure out ways to treat people who get sick because of problems with their yeasts. For example, doctors might be able to come up with medicines that stop the yeasting gene from getting turned on in the first place. Or maybe they could find ways to make sure the yeasted gene stays turned off, just like it should be. That would be really helpful! Doctors could also learn more about other kinds of illnesses by studying yeasts. There are lots of different kinds, and they can cause all sorts of problems. So figuring out how to keep yeasts healthy could teach us how to help other kinds cells stay healthy too! That would definitely be awesome!. Overall, learning more about yeasts is pretty cool and could help a lot of people."
"Sleep is one of the most familiar activities in our lives and yet there are still many unanswered questions related to how it is regulated . The cholinergic system ( or the part of the nervous system that sends signals using a chemical called acetylcholine ) is thought to be important for the phase of sleep that is most similar to being awake , so-called REM sleep . This collection of nerve cells has also been implicated in the process of waking up from sleep . However , it remains unclear how the cholinergic system acts on sleep . Ni , Hou et al . have now used a technique called optogenetics to use light to stimulate the cholinergic system in specific areas in the brains of mice . These experiments found that the activation of the cholinergic system caused awake mice to fall asleep , and promoted more non-REM sleep in sleeping mice . As such , this discovery challenges the previously held view that cholinergic activity was linked to waking up . Acetylcholine affects cells in a similar way to nicotine from cigarettes . In the future , Ni , Hou et al . would like to explore how many nicotine-like substances are released by the cholinergic system in specific brain areas , and to further investigate when and how sleep is promoted .","Scientists wanted to learn more about how certain chemicals in the body help us fall asleep and stay asleep. They focused on special kinds of chemical messengers called ""neurotransmitters"" that travel between nerve cells and tell them what to do. Specifically, they looked at something called the ""thalamus,"" which sends messages back and forth between parts of the brain involved in sleeping and waking up. They chose to focus on a particular kind of neurotransmitter called ""acetylcoline."" There are different types of acetylecoline receptiors, and they found that one type called alpha-7 works best to help us get ready to sleep. Then, they used a technique called ""optogenetics"" to send light signals to the acetycoline producing nerve cells to try to wake up mice. But instead, they found the opposite happened! When they sent light signals, the mice fell asleep. This means that sometimes sending signals to wake someone up doesn't always work, maybe because the body needs to rest. So, they tried turning off the light signals and saw that the mices woke up again. Then they gave the light signal again, and the mouses went back to sleep again. This happens over and over, causing the moses to fall asleep, then wake up, then fall asleep again. Scientists think this might happen because the light makes the nerves send extra messages telling the brain to relax and sleep. By learning more about this, doctors might be able to find better ways to treat problems with falling or staying asleep. That would be great news for anyone who has trouble sleeping! 1) What did the researchers do? 2) Why is it interesting / important? 3) What are the next steps? 4) Do you have any questions? 5) Can you repeat the experiment? 6) How do you know the result is correct?"
"Animal lungs are filled with tiny air sacks called alveoli , where the gas exchanges that keep organisms alive can take place . Small blood vessels known as capillaries come in close contact with the alveoli , allowing oxygen to be extracted from the air into the blood , and carbon dioxide to be released from the blood into the air . The cells that line the inside of these capillaries ( known as pulmonary endothelial cells ) are important actors in these exchanges . After having been damaged , for example by viruses like influenza , the lungs need to regenerate and create new capillaries . Yet , it was still unclear how pulmonary endothelial cells participate in the healing process , and if capillaries contain several populations of endothelial cells that play different roles . To investigate this question , Niethamer et al . used an approach called single-cell analytics to examine individual endothelial cells in the alveoli of mice infected with influenza . This revealed that different subtypes of endothelial cells exist in capillaries , and that some may be able to perform slightly different jobs during lung recovery . Niethamer et al . found that all subtypes could quickly multiply after injury to create more endothelial cells and re-establish gas exchanges . However , one newly identified group ( called Car4-high ECs ) was particularly primed to receive orders from damaged alveoli . These cells were also often found at the sites where the alveoli were most injured . Lung injuries are a major cause of death worldwide . Understanding how pulmonary endothelial cells work when the organ is both healthy and injured should help to find ways to boost repair , and to create therapies that could target these cells ."," Scientists have studied the different kinds of cells found in the lungs of mice and discovered that there are actually three different kinds. They named these three kinds ""macro"", ""micro"" and ""Car4"". By looking closely at the way these cells behave, the scientists found that the ""Car"" cells seemed to be special because they behaved differently from the others. They also saw that these ""Car cells"" were located near areas where the lung tissue was damaged. Then, the researchers gave the mice flu (which damages the lung) and looked again at how the cells behaved. They noticed that the cells called ""Car"", along with another kind of cell called ""mico"", started dividing quickly. Finally, the authors conclude that the Car cells seem to be able to help repair damage caused by illness. They think that the macro cells might be useful for helping doctors understand how to fix problems with patients who have sick lungs. Overall, the study shows that there might be different kinds (or ""subtypes"") of cells inside the lungs that act differently depending on what happens to the body. Understanding how these cells work might help doctors figure out treatments for patients who get really sick. For example, maybe doctors could use the Car or micro cells to help heal someone's lungs after they catch a bad case of the flu. That would be pretty cool! But first, scientists need to learn more about these cells to make sure they don't harm patients instead of helping them. So far, everything looks good! Just keep working hard on figuring out how these special cells work and what they do! Good luck!

"The human body is home to many trillions of microbes; most are harmless , but some may cause disease . To live inside a host , microbes must first attach to host tissues . This process involves multiple proteins on each microbe's surface , called adhesins , which interact with the molecules that make up these tissues . Like all proteins , adhesins are long chains of simpler building blocks called amino acids , and each amino acid is connected to the next via a strong ‘covalent’ bond . Adhesins , however , typically attach bacteria to host molecules through the combined strength of many weak ‘non-covalent’ interactions . It was recently discovered that one adhesin from a bacterium called Streptococcus pyogenes contains a rare , extra covalent bond—called a thioester—in an unusual location between two of its amino acids . S . pyogenes is a common cause of throat infections in humans , and can also cause the life-threatening ‘flesh-eating disease’ . Walden , Edwards et al . have now used a range of computational , biochemical , structural biology and cell-based techniques to study other adhesins that have thioester bonds in more detail . Computational searches identified hundreds of bacterial proteins containing similar bonds . These included many from bacteria that infect humans: such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , which is the most common cause of pneumonia in adults; and Clostridium difficile , which is notorious for causing severe gut infections in hospital patients . Closer examination of the three-dimensional structures of three of these proteins—including one called SfbI from S . pyogenes—revealed that each had a clear thioester bond . Biochemical tests of an additional nine of the identified proteins strongly suggested they too contained thioester bonds . Walden , Edwards et al . then showed that SfbI was able to not only attach to tissues like conventional adhesins , but also chemically react with fibrinogen: a human protein that is essential for blood clotting and commonly found in inflamed tissues and healing wounds . This chemical reaction results in the formation of a covalent bond between SfbI and fibrinogen , which is as stable as the bonds that link the amino acids in a protein chain . Further experiments revealed that SfbI strongly binds to human cells grown in the lab under conditions that mimic tissue inflammation . Finally , Walden , Edwards et al . made a mutant version of SfbI that did not contain a thioester , and found that it could not interact with fibrinogen nor bind to human cells . Together , these findings suggest that thioesters in bacterial adhesins act like ‘chemical harpoons’ , which microbes can use to irreversibly attach themselves to molecules within their host's tissues . This attachment mechanism has not been seen before in host-microbe interactions , and further research is now needed to explore whether interfering with this process could represent a new way to treat bacterial infections ."," Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptoccocus) causes serious illnesses like sore throat, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, and even heart failure. Scientists wanted to know why group A Streptooccocus sticks to the human body. They found that one kind of protein called Sfb1 helps the germ stick to the body. Sfb 1 has something special called “thioester” that makes it stick to human bodies. The researchers made a version of SFB1 without the ""thioestser"" part and tested it. The new version didn't stick to bodies as well as the regular version. Then, the researchers took some chemicals that normally stop things from sticking together and put them onto the ""thingester"" parts of SBF1. Those chemicals helped SFB 1 stick to other things! Finally, the scientists looked at other kinds of germs and saw that those germs had ""thingesters"" too! Other germs might use their thingesters to stick to our bodies and make us sick. Maybe scientists can find ways to keep the germs from sticking to us and making us sick by finding ways to block their thingester parts. That way, we won't get sick from the germ. That sounds good to me! I hope it works! Do you have any questions? Please ask your questions and I will try my best to give you the answers. Thank you! Have a nice day! Let's go outside and play! Don't forget to brush your teeth! Bye bye! Love you! Take care! See you later! Goodbye! ( Singing ) Bye-bye moon, bye-byeee, byeee...). ( Sing to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star ).

"Many animals make use of chemical signals to communicate with other members of their species . Such chemical signals , called pheromones , often allow males and females of the same species to recognize each other before mating . Since the discovery of the very first pheromone in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori at the end of the 1950s , moths have been a model for pheromone research . The sex pheromone communication system in these insects has thus been well described: females emit a mixture of volatile chemicals , which can be detected by the antennae of males up to several hundred meters away . This detection is achieved through neurons with specialized proteins known as pheromone receptors that bind to the chemical signals produced by the females . Recognizing mates by detecting a very specific pheromone signature prevents moths from interbreeding with other species . The evolution of pheromone signals and their corresponding receptors can therefore lead to the rise of new reproductive barriers between populations , and eventually to the emergence of new species . The rate at which sex pheromones have diversified is likely one reason for the existence of over 160 , 000 species of moths . But how did moths’ sex pheromone receptors evolve in the first place ? Previous studies suggested that moth pheromone receptors had appeared just once during evolution . Specifically , they revealed that these receptors belong to the same branch or lineage in the ‘family tree’ of all receptors that detect chemical compounds in moths . This meant that when researchers looked for pheromone receptors in a new species of moth , they always focused on this lineage . But Bastin-Héline et al . have now found that one pheromone receptor from a pest moth called Spodoptera littoralis does not belong to this established group . First , Bastin-Héline et al . inserted this receptor into animal cells grown in the laboratory to confirm that it responds to a specific pheromone produced by S . littoralis . Next , they genetically modified moths of this species and showed that males need this receptor in order to mate . An evolutionary analysis showed that the receptor belongs to a different lineage than all the other known pheromone receptors . Together these results indicate the receptors for sex pheromones must have evolved multiple times independently in moths . These results will open new avenues for deciphering pheromone communication in moths , and lead to further research into this newly discovered lineage of candidate pheromone receptors . Such studies may foster the development of new strategies to control agricultural pests , given that some species of moths can have devastating effects on the yields of certain crops ."," Chemicals called pheronomes allow living creatures to communicate with each other. Some chemicals are only found in males, others only in females. By mixing different amounts of these chemicals, individuals of the same species can tell if another individual is male or female. Scientists wanted to know how these chemicals are recognized by the sense of smell. They looked at tiny structures on the surface of the nose called olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). There are lots of different kinds of OSNs, each recognizing a different kind of chemical. Scientist already knew about one kind of OSN that recognizes a special kind of phero-chemical found mostly in female moth flies. It belongs to a family of chemicals called type I sex phe-romones. Type I sex po-hemones are found in many different kinds moth fly. Scientifics already knew that there was a special type of OSNS that recognise type I po-chemones. They called it PR. Now scientists have found another type of ORSNS that also recognises type I sexual phemones. So, there are actually two different types of ORSN that recognize type I chemicals. This finding helps us understand how living creatures talk to each using chemicals. Knowing more about how this works could help doctors come up with new ways to treat illnesses caused by problems with the sense or smell. And maybe help people who cannot smell at all to be able to smell again. That would improve their quality of life. Researchers hope that learning more about the sense smell will help us learn more about other things that we don’t fully understand yet. Like why some people get sickness and others don’ t. Or why some plants grow faster than others. Or how to make medicines that work better. Or even how to build machines that work like noses. That’ s something to look forward to!"
"Cell membranes are made of two layers of molecules called phospholipids . The types of phospholipid molecules in the outer layer are often different from those in the inner layer . This asymmetry is an important feature of most membranes , but cells also have proteins called ‘scramblases’ that can move ( or scramble ) the phospholipids between the two layers . This scrambling process often marks a cell for destruction but also plays a key role in many activities throughout the body including cell–cell fusion , blood clotting , autoimmune diseases and inflammation . Previous research revealed that a membrane protein called ANO6 is needed for some kinds of phospholipid scrambling . Other proteins that are most closely related to ANO6 are not phospholipid scramblases; instead they are channel proteins that allow ions to pass across cell membranes . ANO6 can also allow ions to flow across membranes , which raised the question: is ANO6 actually a scramblase itself , or does it control other proteins with scramblase activity ? Yu , Whitlock et al . addressed this question by engineering human cells grown in the laboratory to produce the ANO6 protein , and found that these cells had high levels of phospholipid scrambling . Next , the scrambling of phospholipids in these cells was measured while the flow of ions through ANO6 was also recorded . These experiments revealed that these two processes happened almost simultaneously . Yu , Whitlock et al . suggest that this could mean that ANO6 allows ions to leak through when it shuttles phospholipids between layers of cell membranes . ANO1 is an ion channel that is related to ANO6 but it does not have scramblase activity . By designing and testing hybrid proteins that combined parts of ANO6 and ANO1 , Yu , Whitlock et al . identified the part of ANO6 that is responsible for its scramblase activity . Furthermore , computer models of this ‘scrambling domain’ suggest that it forms an unusual groove that faces into the cell membrane , and that could help phospholipids to shuttle between the inner and outer layers of the membrane . Alternatively , this groove could interact with other proteins to regulate phospholipid scrambling; and if so , further work will be needed to identify these unknown proteins . Finally , swapping a relatively small number of features between ANO6 and ANO1 could confer scrambling activity on ANO1 . This suggests that ANO1 may itself have a special relationship to membrane phospholipids . Uncovering the nature of this relationship , if it exists , as well as understanding how ANO6 scrambles phospholipids will challenge structural biologists to generate high-resolution images of these proteins in complex with phospholipids ."," Phospholipes are special kinds of fats that exist in every cell. They move around between parts of the membranes inside cells. Sometimes, they move from the inner side of the outer layer to the outer side of inner layer. Other times, they go from the outer to the inner. This movement happens thanks to something called “phospholipe scrambler” (PLS). Scientists wanted to learn more about PLS. They looked at a kind of fat called ANO 6. They thought ANO-6 had a PLS function. So, they put ANO -6 into cells and watched what happened. They saw that AN0-6 moved the phospoholipes around. Then, scientists made a copy of ANO5 and put it into cells too. They noticed that ANIO5 didn't move any phospolipes! Scientists think they figured out why ANO worked and ANOI did not. They think ANO has a special place that helps it move the phopsolipes. They made a computer picture of what they think ANOs look like. Using this image, they think they can make drugs that only work on ANOs and don't affect anything else. That would be good news since those drugs could treat things like bleeding without making people bleed even more. Scientists want to learn even more about ANOs to see if they can figure out how to make such drugs. They also want to check if ANOs cause bad things to happen in cells. If they do, scientists won't want to use them to fix problems. If ANOs don' t cause bad stuff, then maybe they can help doctors and nurses give patients medicines that really work. Doctors and nurses already use some medicines with ANOs in them. Those include painkillers and drugs that calm people who feel nervous. There are lots of other drugs with ANO s in them too. We don'tknow if those drugs work better or worse in people who take them compared to people who don'ta take them. More studies need to happen to figure out if ANO drugs should be used or not."
"During development and before birth , many organs develop from branched tubes . Whether forming the airways of the lungs , the collecting ducts of the kidneys or the milk ducts of the breast , there are many similarities between these structures . Given their shared tree-like structures , one possibility is that these tissues all form through the same general process . A key challenge is understanding why branched networks develop and pattern in such a way as to assume their functional roles in the adult organ . A unifying theory , which proposes that certain tips stop growing in a random manner , has been proposed to solve this problem . In this theory , the branched mammary gland structures stop growing when the tips of the structure impinge on neighbouring branches . In the kidney , this cessation has been proposed to occur when nephrons – the structures that filter urine from blood – form near the end of the collecting ducts . By growing kidneys in the laboratory and studying developing kidneys in mice , Short et al . investigated whether nephrons do affect collecting duct growth and branch development . The results of these experiments instead suggest that nephron formation has no effect on duct growth or branching . The nephrons also do not appear to affect how quickly the duct cells grow and divide . Moreover , there is no evidence that the cell proliferation in individual branch tips ceases randomly by any other mechanism . Overall , the experiments Short et al . performed suggest that a unifying theory of branching in developing organs may not hold true , at least not in the way that has been envisioned previously ."," The kidneys grow bigger by adding new parts to the outside. These additions happen by joining pieces from the existing kidney to the edge of the growing kidney. How does this join happen? First, a piece of tissue from the edge starts to grow away from the kidneys. Then, this piece of growing tissue joins back to the kidny. This happens again and again, making the kidne bigger and bigger. Scientists wanted to know what happens to this growing tissue once it has joined the kideny. They used mice to see how this works. They cut open the mices and saw that the joining tissue grew smaller as it moved away from he kidney and stopped growing altogether when it reached the edge. They also saw that sometimes the joining tissues did not reach the edge and stayed attached to the original kidney instead. But none of these things happened when the joining pieces became too big to stay connected to the main kidney, so they always joined the edges of the kidnes. So, the scientists think that the reason why the kidnies keep getting bigger is because the joining peaces stop growing when they reach the edges, and this makes them good places to connect new pieces of tissue. And since the joining piece stops growing, it stays small enough to be able to connect to the edges. Finally, the scientist thought about why the joining piecses might stop growing. They thought that maybe the joining piaces stop taking food from the blood because they are too far away from it. Or maybe they stop growing becuase there isn't enough room for them to grow anymore. Maybe both of these reasons are true! Overall, the authors think that joining pieces stop growing because they don't need to get bigger anymore, because they have reached the edges and become good places for new pieces to attach. Because the joining pices stop growing, they are small enough for the new pieces from outside to connect. Because these new pieces connect to something else, they cannot go anywhere else. This helps the kidnie grow bigger and keeps it from getting too big."
"Some cells release molecules , such as hormones and neurotransmitters , to signal to other cells and influence how they work . As part of the release process , these molecules are packaged into small , balloon-like structures called vesicles . Such vesicles move around within cells and are able to find the right place to release their contents to the outside . A cellular compartment called the Golgi complex helps to prepare proteins for release from the cell . Vesicles can bind to tethering proteins on the surface of the Golgi , but it was not clear how these proteins are able to capture the correct kind of vesicle . The prediction was that the proteins are rigid , shaped like pipe cleaners that stick out from the Golgi as a meshwork that traps vesicles . Cheung et al . isolated a specific Golgi tethering protein ( called GCC185 ) from cultured human cells and used a technique called atomic force microscopy to visualize its structure . This revealed that this protein is not rod-like; it is instead rather floppy , and has two arms at one end that may ‘hug’ the incoming vesicle . Cheung et al . showed that this protein needs its middle portion to be floppy to work correctly . This changes the way we think about how vesicles are able to find their corresponding targets on different compartments inside cells . Further experiments are now needed to answer a number of questions . What does the tether look like when actually bound to a vesicle ? What happens after the vesicle binds – how does the tether let go ? What other components are needed for vesicle capture and release ?"," Researchers have studied how proteins attached to the surface of organelles inside cells move apart to allow vesicular traffic between them. They focused on one particular protein, GCC 18 5, which extends away from the Gol gi apparatus. Vesicles coming from the endosome carry cargo destined for the Gol g apparatus, so they need to dock properly before fusion takes place. The researchers wanted to know if GCC's length is flexible, allowing it to bend and change shape slightly. Using several techniques, they found that indeed GCC does have a certain amount of flexibility. This allows it to reach out far enough to grab incoming vescules. The authors propose that GGC first docks vesicals by extending straight out, but once contact is made, it can bend and wrap itself around the vesical, holding it firmly in place until fusion can take place. If GCC cannot bend, vescular traffic is disrupted. The finding that GCG can flexibly extend should help scientists learn more about how vesicial traffic works and what goes wrong when things go awry. This knowledge could lead to treatments for diseases caused by problems with vesiclual trafficking. For example, Alzheimer's disease seems to involve misfolded proteins being deposited in the wrong parts of the braine. One possible cause of this problem could be that GGG cannot stretch and bend to keep vesivals moving correctly. By understanding how GGC works, maybe scientists can figure out a way to keep it functioning properly even when something goes wrong. That could help stop or slow down the progress of Alzheimers. Other diseases involving vescial traffic could potentially be treated in the same way. Since GCC is very flexible, it is hard to get a good picture of it using regular microscopes. So the researchers used a special type of microscope, called an atomic force micoscope, to watch GCC do its job. They also used a technique called proximity label assay to see how closely GCC and the vesciles it interacts with are connected. Together, these tools gave them a much clearer picture of how GCC works."
"Understanding complex systems , such as the weather or the spread of a pandemic , often relies on computational models that can simulate what is happening and what will happen next . Models like these can also be used to investigate biological processes . For example , cellular Potts models ( or CPMs for short ) are regularly used to simulate how cells move , self-organise to form tissues and respond to their surroundings . Computational biologists use a range of specialist skills and software to create these models . However , this can make it difficult for people who do not have programming experience to interact with these simulations and incorporate them in to their own research . If more people could engage with these models , this could help foster closer collaborations and ultimately lead to better models of biological systems . To make CPMs more accessible , Wortel and Textor created a toolbox called Artistoo that allows users to view and interact with simulations using just an internet browser . These simulations are very easy to interact with , and do not require any prior programming knowledge or specialised software . Viewers can input different parameters in to the simulation and watch in real time to see how this affects the biological system being modelled . Wortel and Textor showed that this toolbox can be used to build a range of different biological models and works just as fast as other , more complex programming tools . Artistoo has many potential applications and is a valuable education , learning , and collaboration tool . It may also encourage more open science , as having more accessible computational models could help with peer review and make it easier to collaborate across different research fields . A similar approach could be used to provide access to many other types of models in biology and beyond ."," Researchers have developed a tool called “Artistool” that allows people without advanced computer skills to use a simulation program called Cellular Potatoes Model (CPM) to visualize and experiment with virtual cells and tissue. Previously, scientists who wanted to use CPM had to learn how to use specialized programs like Compucell3D or Morphes. However, these programs often required additional plug-ins and could only be accessed online through a server. With Artistool, researchers hope to make CPM more accessible to a wider range of people by making it easier to install and use. They did this by writing the code for Artistool in JavaScript, which means it can run directly on someone’s web browser instead of needing a separate program. They tested whether running CPM in JavaScript would slow down the simulations enough to make them less useful. They found that there wasn’t much difference in speed between running CPP in JavaScript versus C++. They also tested if the graphics quality would suffer by running C++ in JavaScript. They discovered that the graphics didn’t look worse when running C++) in JavaScript compared to running it in C++ alone. Lastly, they showed some examples of how Artistool can be used to simulate things like cancer growth and wound healing. Overall, the researchers think that Artistool will be helpful for teaching people about CPM and doing research on how cells behave. They believe that having more people able to access and use CPP will lead to more ideas and discoveries about how cells work together to form tissues and organs. They want to encourage others to try using Artistool and see what interesting things they come up with. They think that having a lot of different people working on the same problem can lead to creative solutions that might not have been thought of otherwise. They hope that by making CPM easier to use, more people will get interested in studying how cells communicate with each other and how that affects the body as a whole."
"Although Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder , its cause is not known and there is no cure . The symptoms of Parkinson's disease , which include tremor and slowing of voluntary movements , get progressively worse over time . The numbers of neurons in certain brain regions also decrease , causing those parts of the brain to shrink; this is known as ‘atrophy’ . However , no conclusive signs of atrophy have been found in the brains of people in the early stages of the disease . One theory suggests that Parkinson's disease is caused by a toxic protein that is able to spread from neuron to neuron . Recent advances in brain imaging have made it possible to map networks in the living human brain—the so-called brain connectome . These networks could form the ‘highways’ through which a disease-causing agent might spread . The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative ( PPMI ) is a large study that collects data from hundreds of people in an effort to identify the causes of Parkinson's disease . Zeighami et al . have now analyzed MRI scans that were collected as part of this initiative , which show the structure of the brains of 230 people in the early stages of Parkinson's disease . Comparing these scans to those from age-matched healthy individuals allowed Zeighami et al . to identify the set of brain regions that show atrophy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease . These regions correspond to a normal brain network , and the relative extent of atrophy in each brain region supports the theory that the disease spreads through the connectome . The patients who were enrolled in this study will continue to be evaluated on a yearly basis . Zeighami et al . plan to continue mapping how the disease progresses throughout the brain and to relate this to the development of new symptoms of Parkinson's disease .","Scientists studied people who had Parkinson’s Disease (PD) and those without it to learn more about what happens in the early stages of the condition. They did this by examining the brains and behavior of participants. First, they looked at the brains using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Then, they examined the brains again using a special kind of MRI called diffusion tensor imaging. This allowed them to find areas of the brains that might be affected by PD. Next, they used a technique called independent component analyses (ICA), which helped them figure out how the different parts of a person’s brain worked together. Lastly, they checked how well the people with PD could move and functioned by giving them a test called Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The scientists discovered that there were certain groups of brain areas that seemed to be affected differently depending on whether someone had PD or not. Also, they saw that some of these areas were related to problems moving and functioning normally. Importantly, they noticed that these areas matched up with ones that got less blood flow in people with normal aging. This suggested that the problem might get worse as people grew old. Altogether, these results suggest that the brain areas involved in PD might break down because of a problem spreading through the brain. This could cause problems with moving and thinking clearly. Further research should try to find ways to stop this problem from happening. If successful, this could improve how doctors treat PD. This will make life easier for people with the condition and their families. It will also save money by reducing healthcare costs. This study shows that researchers can use MRI techniques to discover new ways to think about diseases like PD. Hopefully, this will lead to finding treatments for these conditions. This is good news for anyone who has or might develop PD. It is also encouraging for anyone trying to find a cure for any neurological disorder."
"The genetic information every cell needs to work properly is encoded in molecules of DNA that are much longer than the cell itself . A key challenge in biology is to understand how DNA is organized to fit inside each cell , whilst still providing access to the information that it contains . Since the way DNA is organized can influence which genes are active , rearranging DNA plays an important role in controlling how cells behave . In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria , a protein called H-NS contributes to DNA reorganization by forming or rupturing loops in the DNA in response to changes in temperature , the levels of salt and other aspects of the cell’s surroundings . In controlling loop formation , it dictates whether specific genes are switched on or off . However , it remains unclear how H-NS detects the environmental changes . To address this question , van der Valk et al . used biochemical techniques to study the activity of H-NS from E . coli under different environmental conditions . The experiments show that changes in the environment cause structural changes to H-NS , altering its ability to form DNA loops . A previously unnoticed region of the protein acts as a switch to control these structural changes , and ultimately affects which genes are active in the cell . These findings shed new light on how bacteria organize their DNA and the strategies they have developed to adapt to different environments . The new protein region identified in H-NS may also be present in similar proteins found in other organisms . In the future , this knowledge may ultimately help to develop new antibiotic drugs that target H-NS proteins in bacteria ."," Our bodies are made up of tiny building blocks called atoms, which combine to form molecules, cells, organs, and eventually, organisms. Just like everything else around us, these molecules are always moving and changing position. Some molecules stick together to form larger structures, while others stay free floating. Scientists use something called “protein” to keep things like our bones, muscles, and skin intact. There are lots of different kinds of protections out there, all doing slightly different jobs. One type of protein called H-NST helps hold our DNA together. Sometimes, though, things don’t go exactly as planned and things fall apart. That’s why scientists are trying to figure out what makes things break down and come back together again. They think one way to do this is through something called ""environment"". So far, they know that things like salt, heat, and acidity affect how well H-NsT works. But there might be other things affecting it too! By studying how H-NT works and how it doesn’t work, scientists hope to better understand how to fix problems with proteins like H-NDT. Eventually, they want to make sure that proteins stay put wherever they need to be, so people stay healthy and happy! And you? What would you like to know about proteins today? Let us know in the comments below! [Image description: An image of a cartoon scientist wearing goggles and holding test tubes labeled “Protein” and “Environment”.

"Kidneys filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine . Each kidney contains many structures called nephrons which separate the waste from the blood . The number of nephrons in a kidney varies between people , and those with low numbers have a higher risk of chronic kidney disease . Nephrons are formed before birth from a specific group of so-called progenitor cells . Each of these cells can either divide to make others like itself , or it can specialize to make nephron cells . At the end of embryonic kidney development , all the progenitor cells become nephron cells . Cells that specialize to become part of a nephron first go through a change called a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Epithelial cells move less than mesenchymal cells , and also develop a clear structure where the two ends of the cell adapt to different roles . Evidence suggests that a cell communication process called WNT/β-catenin signaling controls this transition . Yet the details of how this transition is controlled are not fully understood . One way to activate WNT/β-catenin signaling is with R-spondin proteins , which have been found in developing kidneys . Vidal et al . studied R-spondins during the embryonic development of kidneys in mice . Removing R-spondins stopped the progenitor cells from producing more of themselves and increased the number that died . The R-spondins were also needed for the progenitor cells to specialize as nephron cells through the mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Further results revealed that R-spondins activate WNT/β-catenin signaling in these cells , even though the proteins that usually act as R-spondin receptors ( called LGR4/5/6 ) could be removed without affecting the results . This suggests that R-spondins interact with different receptor proteins during kidney development . These findings highlight the role of R-spondins and WNT/β-catenin signaling in kidney development . Future studies will seek the receptor proteins that R-spondins interact with in kidneys . They may also look to understand how R-spondins balance their different roles in progenitor cells and during cell specialization . These results in mice could also be extended to determine their relevance in human health and disease , including chronic kidney disease , which is responsible for more deaths than breast or prostate cancer ."," During the early stages of kidney growth, cells need to grow and take on certain jobs before they turn into something else. To help them do this, special chemicals called signals need to be sent to the cells. One group of signals comes from a family of proteas called R-Spondins. It turns out that there are three kinds of RSpondin proteins, and they seem to work in the same way. Scientists already knew that R-proteins are needed for kidney cells to grow normally. They also know that RSponding proteins might be useful for making new kinds of kidneys. But exactly how R-Proteins work wasn’t really understood. So, scientists looked closely at mice without any R- proteins. They found that the mice seemed fine, except for problems with their kidneys! When the researchers got rid of one kind of RSPONDIN protein, things didn’t go well, but when they got rid two kinds of proteans, things went very wrong. That meant that the two kinds worked in the exact same way! Then, the scientists looked at the cells that usually make kidneys and saw that they weren’t working right. They think that’s because the cells couldn’t get the signal they need from the R-PROTEINS. Because the cells didn’ t get the right signal, they couldn’ t turn into the right kind of cell. Without the right kinds of cells, the kidneys don’ t develop correctly. All of this tells us that RSPONGDINS are really important for making kidneys, and that we need to understand more about how they work before we can figure out ways to use them to make better kidneys for people who need them. Things are moving forward slowly but surely! We’ll let you know as soon as we learn anything else. Thank you for reading!"
"The inner surface of the vertebrate eye is lined with a multilayered structure known as the retina . The bottom layer of the retina is composed of rods and cones—neurons that are directly sensitive to light—and is called the photoreceptor layer . Rods function primarily in dim light and provide black-and-white vision , while cones support daytime vision and are responsible for colour perception . Unlike the upper layers of the retina , the photoreceptor layer does not contain blood vessels: oxygen and nutrients are instead provided by a structure just underneath the retina called the choroid . The eye relies on the rods and cones converting light into electrical signals , and the photoreceptor layer must remain free of blood vessels for this process to work properly . If blood vessels extend into the photoreceptor layer from rest of the retina ( which is above it ) or the choroid ( below ) , they can disrupt the retina and give rise to a condition called age-related macular degeneration , which is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults . Within the eye , the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels is stimulated by a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , while an inhibitor protein called sFLT-1 prevents the growth of new blood vessels in the other tissues of the eye like the cornea . However , it has not been clear what keeps the photoreceptor layer ( and also the cells that support the photoreceptor layer ) free of blood vessels , and what happens to disrupt this process of vascular demarcation in age-related macular degeneration . Now , Luo et al . reveal that cells in the photoreceptor layer produce sFLT-1 , and that the levels of this protein are indeed reduced in people with age-related macular degeneration . Using genetic and pharmacological methods , they show that a reduction in sFLT-1 triggers blood vessels to grow into the photoreceptor layer from above or below . Luo et al . also report two new genetic mouse models in which blood vessels form spontaneously in the photoreceptor layer at an early age , which should prove useful for further research into age-related macular degeneration ."," Researchers have learned that there is a special kind of blood vessel called a choriocapillaris that helps keep the eye safe. They know that sometimes, this blood vessel grows wrongly and causes bad things like bleeding and swelling. They think that this happens because another kind of special blood vessel, called a photoreactor, makes a chemical that stops the chorioccipallaris from growing. When the researchers took away the chemical, the chorio capillaris grew. To learn more about what happens, the researchers looked at different kinds of mice. Some of them had a special gene taken away, and others had a different version of the gene put into the mouse. All of the mice were kept in clean cages and fed special food. After looking closely at all of the different kinds and versions of the genes, the scientists saw that the mices without the special gene were okay, but the ones with the extra copy of the special genes had the wrong kind of vessels growing. So, the scientist think that having too much of the chemical that comes from the photreactors keeps the choroiccipallaries from growing the right way. This means that maybe doctors could give patients medicines that stop making the chemical from forming, so the chrio capillaries would stay safe. But, more studies still need to happen before we know for sure if giving patients medicine like this would be good. It might make things better, or it might make them worse. More studies need to figure out which one it would be best to choose. If the scientists find out that giving patients medicnes like this is good, then maybe doctors will be able to give patients special pills to take instead of going to the doctor all the time. That would save money and time for everyone! And, it would let people see better so they could do more fun things outside and go on walks and play sports and stuff like that. That sounds really nice!"
"Most cells are programmed to maintain a certain size . This property , known as size control , is achieved by balancing growth and division , such that a cell will only divide after it reaches a certain size . However , and despite years of research , it is largely unknown how cells sense their size ( or growth ) to be able to divide accordingly . One theory proposes that there is a “sizer” protein inside cells , and that cells measure the abundance of this protein and use it to link cell size to the process of division . However , the existence of such a protein remained unproven . Li , Liu et al . have now used the cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas to identify a candidate sizer protein . Chlamydomonas cells , like many other algae , can grow to become very large mother cells that then divide one or more times in succession to produce many daughter cells . Larger mother cells undergo more divisions than smaller mother cells in order to produce daughter cells of a correct size . Using a range of genetic and biochemical techniques , Li , Liu et al . identified a protein that is produced in Chlamydomonas cells just before they begin to divide . Larger mother cells contain more of this protein than smaller cells and the protein encourages cells to divide . For example , mutant cells that lack this protein divided too few times , while cells that produce too much of it divided too many times . The protein , called CDKG1 , belongs to a family of proteins that regulate cell division in many organisms . CDKG1 is a kinase – an enzyme that alters the activity of other proteins by adding a phosphate group on to them . In Chlamydomonas , CDKG1 couples cell size to cell division by altering the activity of an important protein called the retinoblastoma-related protein that controls cell division in numerous organisms . This protein is also frequently disrupted in cancers in humans . These findings shed new light on a molecular pathway for size control . Future work will need to determine how the accumulation of CDKG1 links to the size of a mother cell and how it is inactivated once daughter cells reach the appropriate size ."," Researchers have studied how cells decide what size to be before dividing into smaller versions of themselves. They used a type of single-celled algae called Chlamydamonas to study this problem. They found that there is a special kind of ""gas"" inside the cells that tells them how big to get before dividine. This gas is made by something called Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK) proteins. One particular type of CDKS called CDKGD1 makes sure that the cells don't get too big by turning off the machines that make the ""gas"". If you remove CDKGA1 from the cells, they will get really big because there won't be enough ""gas"", but if you add extra copies of CDPKGA1 back in, the cells will know to stop growing and divide even though they aren't the right size yet. So, the researchers think that having just the right amount of CDPG1 is how cells figure out when to stop making the ""growth gas."" It's still not totally clear exactly how this works, but it looks like CDPKGD1 is pretty important for figuring out when it's time to split apart! 1DOI:http://dx.doi.org/118.12916.00210.7574/bio-soft.119.1.107100.1301.0.01DOIs: http : // dx. do i /10 137 093 113 0 031 1 ; http : ///dx. doi/1 0. 12 9 16. 2 1. 0 ; http: / /dx.d oi/ 18.1 29 21.0 24 1"
"Humans are part of a group of animals called vertebrates , which are all the animals with backbones . Broadly , all vertebrates have a similar body shape with a head at one end and a left and right side that are similar to each other . Although this is not very obvious in humans , vertebrate bodies are derived from pairs of segments arranged from the head to the tail . Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development . Cells from each somite then divide , grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column , muscles , skin , and other tissues that make up each segment . Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow , but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans . Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated . Budjan et al . grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids , and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites . Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation . Once the somites formed , Budjan et al . measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used . They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes . This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time . This can provide insights into the development and evolution of humans and other animals that could then help scientists understand diseases such as the development of abnormal spinal curvature that affects around 1 in 10 , 000 newborns ."," During the development in utero of a baby, the bones of the backbone (vertebrae) are created in a stepwise manner. First, small pieces of bone material are added to the developing backbone, which eventually fuse together to form the full backbone. Each piece of bone is built from a group of cells called a somite. Understanding exactly how these somites work is difficult since scientists cannot easily watch them develop inside a pregnant woman. Therefore, researchers tried to figure out how somites develop by growing human cells in a lab dish. They started with cells taken from a very early human embroyo, before the embroyos’s backbone had begun to form. Then, they put these cells into a special kind of lab dish called an organoid. Organoids are like tiny versions of the organs they come from, and they contain many kinds of cells working together. After putting the cells into the organoid, the researchers added chemicals to mimick some of the events that happen during the development. Some of these chemicals helped the cells turn into the kind of cells needed to build the backbones, and some of them stopped the cells from turning into other kinds of cell. Finally, the scientists saw that adding certain chemicals at certain times caused the cells to start forming somites. They also saw that if they waited longer without giving any chemicals, the cells would stop being able to form somites altogether. Overall, the results of this experiment will help scientists learn more about how somite cells work and how they might be used to better understand diseases that affect the development and growth of the human backbone and other bones. For example, the methods shown here could be used in future experiments to see whether somites from patients who have spina bifida (a condition where the back bone does not close properly) respond differently to the same chemicals compared to healthy people. If there are differences between the responses of the two sets of cells, scientists might get closer to figuring out why spina-bifida patients have their condition."
"People with various forms paralysis not only have difficulties getting around , but also are less able to use many communication technologies including computers . In particular , strokes , neurological injuries , or diseases such as ALS can lead to severe paralysis and make it very difficult to communicate . In rare instances , these disorders can result in a condition called locked-in syndrome , in which the affected person is aware but completely unable to move or speak . Several researchers are looking to help people with severe paralysis to communicate again , via a system called a brain-computer interface . These devices record activity in the brain either from the surface of the scalp or directly using a sensor that is surgically implanted . Computers then interpret this activity via algorithms to generate signals that can control various tools , including robotic limbs , powered wheelchairs or computer cursors . Such tools would be invaluable for many people with paralysis . Pandarinath , Nuyujukian et al . set out to study the performance of an implanted brain-computer interface in three people with varying forms of paralysis and focused specifically on a typing task . Each participant used a brain-computer interface known as “BrainGate” to move a cursor on a computer screen displaying the letters of the alphabet . The participants were asked to “point and click” on letters – similar to using a normal computer mouse – to type specific sentences , and their typing rate in words per minute was measured . With recently developed computer algorithms , the participants typed faster using the brain-computer interface than anyone with paralysis has ever managed before . Indeed , the highest performing participant could , on average , type nearly 8 words per minute . The next steps are to adapt the system so that brain-computer interfaces can control commercial computers , phones and tablets . These devices are widely available , and would allow paralyzed users to take advantage of a range of applications that can be easily downloaded and customized . This development might enable brain-computer interfaces to not only allow people with neurological disorders to communicate , but also assist other people with paralysis in a number of ways ."," People who suffer from paralytic injuries can communicate with computers using something called a Brain Computer Interface (BCI). However, the technology needs improvement before it becomes widely adopted. Researchers improved the BBI technology so that it works better than ever before. They did this by improving the computer program that reads the person's thoughts. Three people with spinal cord injuries tested the new version of the BNI and were able to send messages to each other using their thoughts. The researchers hope that someday soon people with severe paralytics will be able to use the BNC to talk to friends, family, and doctors. This technology could also let scientists learn about the thoughts of people who are unable to move or speak. This could give them a better understanding of how to improve care for patients with severe injuries. The findings reported in this article provide evidence that BNIs can be useful tools for helping people with serious injuries communicate. More testing is needed to determine how effective the BNCS really is. Overall, the authors think that their work shows promise for the development of advanced technologies that can help people with mobility issues communicate effectively. The authors believe that their findings could pave the way for new ways to help people overcome obstacles related to movement disorders. By doing so, they aim to enhance the lives of those affected by such challenges. The ultimate goal of this research is to aid in the creation of innovative solutions that empower people living with mobility difficulties to live fuller lives. The study highlights the importance of collaboration among researchers, clinicians, and industry partners to advance the field of neuroscience and develop cutting-edge technologies that benefit society as a whole. The research team emphasized the significance of working together to solve complex problems and highlighted the potential impact of their discoveries on real-world applications. The article concludes by expressing optimism about the prospects of BNCs becoming a reality in the near future."
"Hunting is an innate behaviour that relies on predators executing a precise set of actions to identify , approach , target , and strike prey . In vertebrates ( animals with a backbone ) , the identity of the brain circuits that trigger hunting is still unclear . These networks are thought to link sensory perception ( seeing prey ) with a specialised action ( starting an attack ) . Larval zebrafish are a good model in which to study these circuits , because they have a tiny , transparent brain where neurons can be observed in real time . In addition , it is expected that the networks that control hunting in this species will be preserved across other vertebrates . To discover these networks , Antinucci et al . genetically engineered zebrafish larvae so that their brain cells would ‘glow’ when they became active . This revealed which individual brain cells would turn on when zebrafish started to hunt . These neurons were in a part of the brain called the pretectum , which receives visual information about prey from the eye . Next , Antinucci et al . harnessed a technique called optogenetics to artificially turn on these brain cells in the pretectum , which caused the fish to start hunting even when prey was absent . In fact , stimulating just one pretectal cell was enough to trigger the behaviour . Conversely , killing pretectal brain cells using precise laser surgery hindered hunting in zebrafish exposed to prey . These experiments suggest that pretectal brain cells act like a command centre that controls hunting . They likely play a decision-making role , determining when animals do and do not respond to events in their surroundings . Similar neurons likely control other types of behaviour . Understanding how these circuits work at the cellular level in zebrafish may help scientist study them in other organisms , such as humans ."," Zebrafishes need to catch food to survive, so they perform something called ""hunting"" behavior. Hunting requires several actions, such as swimming toward the prey, turning toward the tail, and catching the prey. Scientists studied how zebra fish perform hunting behavior. They discovered a part of the brain that controls hunting behavior in zebras. When scientists activated this part of brain, the zebrus performed hunting behavior even without food. If scientists turned off this part, the fish no longer performed hunting. Scientist think that this part helps the fish decide to hunt. They also know that this brain part sends messages to other parts of the brains. Scientsts hope that understanding how this part works will help them learn more about how the whole brain works. This knowledge could help doctors treat people who have problems with their brains. For example, someone who has trouble moving could get treatment that makes this part work better. People who understand how the brain works can help make treatments like this happen. That is why studying how the zeesbrafish brain works is important. Scientifsits studied the zesrabrafish because it is easy to see what is happening in its brain. Also, scientists can change genes in the zesafrash to study how those genes affect the way the brain woks. Scientifsts can watch how the fish behaves after changing genes. Then, scientists compare the behavior of fish with changed genes to the behavior fo fish with normal genes. Comparing the two kinds of fish shows what genes do. Studying how the brains of zebrfsh work could help scientists figure out how to treat people whose brains don't work normally. So, figuring out how the bran of zesbafrash works could help people. Figuring out what genes control how the brian works could also help doctors find ways to fix things that go wrong in the brain."
"Biomedical scientists have invested significant effort into making it easy to perform lots of experiments quickly and cheaply . These “high throughput” methods are the workhorses of modern “systems biology” efforts . However , we simply cannot perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type , genetic mutation and other conditions . In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets , or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored . But which experiments should we pick ? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately , the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be , or a combination of the two ? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time . However , computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments , and machine learning algorithms allow computers to “learn” how to make predictions and decisions based on the data they’ve previously processed . Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed “active learning” could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done . Now , Naik et al . have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope . The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you can’t predict ( or that you predicted incorrectly ) than from just confirming your confident predictions . The results of the robot-driven experiments showed that the active learning approach outperforms strategies a human might use , even when the potential outcomes of individual experiments are not known beforehand . The next challenge is to apply these methods to reduce the cost of achieving the goals of large projects , such as The Cancer Genome Atlas ."," Researchers have developed a way to screen chemicals for their effects on proteins in living cells. Instead of testing every possible drug-protein pair, the researchers designed a computer program that chooses the best combinations itself. First, the program makes predictions about the effects that various drugs might have on different proteins based on previous observations. Then, the team tests the predictions by adding the drugs to live yeast cells and seeing how the proteINS behave. Based on the results, the computer program updates its predictions so that future choices focus on the most interesting possibilities. Using this strategy, the authors successfully predicted the effects drugs had on 49 different proteINS. This suggests that the program can automatically discover relationships between drugs and proteINs without knowing anything about the proteIN beforehand. Such automatic exploration could speed up the process of finding connections between existing drugs and new uses for them. For instance, the study found that a drug commonly used to treat malaria also has effects on yeast proteins involved in the response to stressful environments like heat shock. This result hints at potential applications of the drug outside of treating malaria. Overall, the findings demonstrate that computers can play a role in guiding experimental studies of drug effects on living organisms. Future work should explore ways to apply this technique to larger datasets and higher-throughput experiments. Doing so could accelerate the search for new uses of existing drugs, as well as reveal unexpected links between seemingly unrelated proteins. Ultimately, this could lead to the discovery of novel treatments for diseases and insights into the underlying mechanisms of health and disease. While the current study focused on yeasts, the techniques could potentially be applied to other organisms, including humans. By automating the process, the approach could save time and money compared to traditional trial-and-error screening methods. Additionally, the technique could aid in identifying potential side effects of drugs by examining their impact on proteINS beyond the intended target."
"When a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell , this creates a single-celled embryo called a zygote that will go on to divide repeatedly throughout development . The zygote inherits the contents of the egg including many important proteins that initially control how the embryo develops . In mice , the embryo takes over control of development once the zygote has divided to form a two-celled embryo . This transition of control destroys the maternally inherited proteins and selectively activates zygotic genes and some DNA sequences called transposable elements that evolved from virus DNA . One of the proteins inherited from the egg cell is called Stella . Embryos that lack Stella die within the first few cell divisions , which suggests that the protein is needed during the earliest stages of development . However , it is not clear what Stella's role in the early embryo is . Huang , Kim et al . decided to investigate how Stella might affect the genes that are switched on during development by using a technique called RNA-seq to study egg cells and early embryos from mice . Two-celled embryos that lacked Stella could not activate a number of genes that produce proteins that are critical for development . They also failed to activate a group of transposable elements called endogenous retroviruses . In particular , a lack of Stella significantly reduced the activity of an endogenous retrovirus called MuERV-L . Further experiments showed that MuERV-L is needed for normal embryonic development , and so suggests that transposable elements play important roles in this process . Future studies will aim to explore these roles in more detail . It will also be important to identify the genes that Stella targets in embryos , and to investigate the roles that similar maternally inherited proteins play in early embryonic development ."," Embryos need to use instructions stored in their DNA to guide them through the process of growth and development. Before the embroy starts growing, the mother provides some guidance through her own DNA. But once the embrio starts growing on its own, it needs to rely solely on its DNA. Scientists studied how the embrios do this by looking at how the new set of DNA instructions affects the way the embrios grow. They did this by studying how the DNA changed after removing a specific part of the mothers DNA. They found that without this part of DNA, the embros grew slower and had problems turning on certain parts of their DNA. Further investigation revealed that the missing piece of DNA helped turn on certain pieces of DNA that allow the embrys to grow properly. Overall, scientists learned that there are different ways to turn on different parts of the DNA, and that some ways are better than others depending on what the DNA does. Understanding how the different ways of turning on DNA works could help us learn how to fix problems like those caused by diseases. This knowledge could also help us understand how to safely edit the DNA inside living things. This would let us add or remove traits from plants and animals, which could lead to improvements in agriculture and medicine. This study used frogs as models, but the methods used here might apply to other kinds of living things too. The authors think that future studies should look at whether the different methods of turning DNA on are related to differences in how the proteasome breaks apart the DNA. The proteasme is a group of small molecules that break apart long chains of amino acids. Some scientists think that the proteosme might be involved in breaking apart the strands of DNA so that they can be copied, or so that new copies can be made. Other scientists think the proteamse might only be involved later in the process, when the DNA is ready to be copied again. Studying how the proetasome is involved might tell us more about why different ways exist to turn DNA on."
"An animal that finds particularly nutritious and palatable food will often develop a long-lasting memory—even if they experience that event only once . One example of this is the ability of the fruit fly Drosophila to form a long-term association between a sugar reward and a specific odor that was present when they received the reward . The consumption of sugar triggers the release of a chemical called dopamine on specific compartments of a brain structure called the mushroom body . Dopamine then acts to modify the connection between cells called “Kenyon cells” , which encode specific odors , and the neurons that send signals out from the mushroom body ( called MBONs ) . The result is the formation of a memory that links the odor with the reward . However , little is known about how this process differs for long-term vs . short-term memories , and how it can occur when the fly has experienced the odor and reward together on only a single occasion . To find out , Ichinose et al . combined behavioral testing of fruit flies with genetics . The results confirmed that the dopamine neurons and the MBONs that project to a single compartment of the mushroom body , called α1 , are both required for the formation of long-term odor-reward memories , but not their short-term equivalents . These neurons are called PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 , respectively . Unexpectedly , anatomical data revealed that PAM-α1 dopamine neurons receive input from MBON-α1; that is , long-term memory formation involves a feedback circuit: from PAM-α1 to Kenyon cells , then to MBON-α1 and back to PAM-α1 . Blocking feedback from the MBON-α1 onto the PAM-α1 neurons shortly after odor-reward training disrupted long-term memory formation . Conversely , blocking feedback at a later stage did not . This suggests that prolonged activation of PAM-α1 by MBON-α1 helps to strengthen newly established memories , converting them into memories that will last for a long time . The discovery of a specific circuit that supports long-term , but not short-term , memory formation in fruit flies is consistent with evidence of distinct mechanisms underlying these processes in mammals . Further work is now required to determine whether feedback circuits similar to those in fruit flies also contribute to reward-based learning in other animals ."," When flies smell something sweet, like sugar, they remember it well even if they haven't smelled it again for days. Scientists know that special chemicals called neurotransmitters help make good memories happen. They also know that a certain kind of neurotransmission happens in a place inside the fly's brain called mushroom bodies. However, scientists didn't really know why this happened. To figure out why this happens, researchers looked closer at all the pieces of the puzzle. First, they knew that there are two kinds of good memories: ones that last a little bit (called short term memory) and ones that can last a very long time (called long term memory). Second, they already knew that a chemical called dopamine helps make both kinds of memory happen. Third, they learned that a group called dopaminergic neurons makes dopamine. Fourth, they figured out that a few kinds of dopamingeric neuron are especially important for making long term memories happen because those neurons connect to places in the mushrooms where good memories are made. Fifth, they discovered that a tiny piece of tissue inside the mushrombs called MBON helps make long term good memories. Sixth, they found that a special kind of MBORN called MBOR-alpha-one helps make good long term memoriestoo. All of these things helped scientists discover that a loop formed by MBOR alpha-one and the dopamnergic nerves helps make sure that good memories stick around forever! That means that sometimes, things happening in our heads can change how our heads work later on. That's pretty cool! And it shows that even though lots of stuff in our world looks really complicated, sometimes you can figure out how it works by breaking it apart into smaller and smaller pieces. That makes figuring out big mysteries easier and easier! And since science is all about solving mysteries, that's awesome!"
"Malaria is a significant health concern , killing about 400 , 000 people each year . While antimalarial drugs and insecticides have successfully reduced deaths over the last 20 years , the parasite that causes malaria is starting to gain resistance to these treatments . Vaccines offer an alternative route to preventing the disease . However , the most advanced vaccine currently available provides less than 50% protection . Vaccines work by encouraging the body to develop proteins called antibodies , which can recognize the parasite and trigger an immune response that blocks the infection . These antibodies target a molecule on the parasite’s surface called circumsporozoite protein , or CSP for short . Therefore , having a better understanding of how antibodies interact with CSP could help researchers design more effective treatments . A lot of what is known about malaria has come from studying this disease in mice . However , it remained unclear whether antibodies produced in rodents combat the malaria-causing parasite in a similar manner to human antibodies . To answer this question , Kucharska , Thai et al . studied a mouse antibody called 3D11 , which targets CSP on the surface of a parasite that causes malaria in rodents . The interaction between CSP and 3D11 was studied using three different techniques in order to better understand how the structure of CSP changes when bound by antibodies . The experiments showed that although CSP has a highly flexible structure , it forms a more stable , spiral-like architecture when bound to multiple copies of 3D11 . A similar type of assembly was previously observed in studies investigating how CSP interacts with human antibodies . Further investigation revealed that the molecular connections between 3D11 and CSP share a lot of similarities with how human antibodies recognize CSP . These findings reveal how mammals evolved similar mechanisms for detecting and inhibiting malaria-causing parasites . This highlights the robust features antibodies need to launch an immune response against malaria , which could help develop a more effective vaccine ."," Researchers wanted to know why certain antibodys called 3DN11 help protect people from getting infected with parasites called Plasmosium. They already knew that 3dn11 works by sticking to another kind of protein called Circumsporzoin Protein (CSP). So, first, they made sure that 2 kinds of 2D1N11 worked exactly the same way as the ones that naturally occur in humans. Then, they figured out how 3d1n11 stuck to CSP by looking at pictures taken while 3dh1nI1 was mixed with CSP. Finally, they looked at how 2d1NII behaved when mixed together with CPS. They found that 1 kind of 9d1NI11 helped 2 other kinds of d1nII stick together better so that they could fight off the parasite better. This finding helps scientists understand how antibodied like 3dl1Nll can help protect us from getting sick. It also shows that even though different antiboddies look slightly different, they still work in the same ways. This knowledge could help doctors find better ways to treat diseases caused by parasites. It could also help them figure out how to use antibodties to fight other diseases. For example, they could learn how to make stronger antiboddy treatments that would kill cancer cells or viruses before they spread throughout your body. Or, they might discover how to give you just the right amount of antibodty so that it keeps you from catching a disease in the first place. That would be really helpful! And, who knows? Maybe someday they'll even find a way to make antiboddi that work even better than the ones we already have! That would definitely be awesome! By the way, if you want to learn more about this topic, check out the article called ""Antibody engineering"" in the Encyclopedia Britannica. It has lots of cool facts and info about how scientists use antibody to fight diseases!"
"Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent severe COVID-19 . Two doses of mRNA vaccine protect against serious illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 . They do this , in part , by encouraging the immune system to make specialised proteins known as antibodies that recognise the virus . Most of the vaccine research so far has focussed on these antibodies , but they are only one part of the immune response . Vaccines also activate immune cells called T cells . These cells have two main roles , coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected with viruses . It is likely that they play a key role in preventing severe COVID-19 . There are many kinds of T cells , each with a different role . Currently , the identity and characteristics of the T cells that protect against COVID-19 is unclear . Different types of T cells have unique proteins on their surface . Examining these proteins can reveal details about how the T cells work , which part of the virus they recognise , and which part of the body they protect . A tool called cytometry by time of flight allows researchers to measure these proteins , one cell at a time . Using this technique , Neidleman , Luo et al . investigated T cells from 11 people before vaccination and after their first and second doses . Five people had never had COVID-19 before , and six had already recovered from COVID-19 . Neidleman , Luo et al . found that the T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the two groups differed . In people who had never had COVID-19 before , the second dose of vaccine improved the quality and quantity of the T cells . The same was not true for people who had already recovered from COVID-19 . However , although their T cells did not improve further after a second vaccine dose , they did show signs that they might offer more protection overall . The proteins on the cells suggest that they might last longer , and that they might specifically protect the nose , throat and lungs . Neidleman , Luo et al . also found that , for both groups , T cells activated by vaccination responded in the same way to different variants of the virus . This work highlights the importance of getting both vaccine doses for people who have never had COVID-19 . It also suggests that vaccination in people who have had COVID-19 may generate better T cells . Larger studies could show whether these patterns remain true across the wider population . If so , it is possible that delivering vaccines to the nose or throat could boost immunity by mimicking natural infection . This might encourage T cells to make the surface proteins that allow them to home to these areas ."," Researchers studied how well COVID-related T cells react to different versions of the coronavirus (called ""variants"") in people who got COVID-like illness and recovered without getting a COVID shot (called “convalesecnt”) versus people who only received COVID shots. They looked at how well the T- cells recognized different versions (ancestral, B.1.17, and B. 1.35) of the virus. All versions of COVID induced similar reactions in the T -cells of both groups of people. However, the T –cells from people who had gotten sick with COVID and then got the shots seemed to be able to travel to places where the virus might infect them, such as the nose, throat, and lungs, better than the T–cells in people whose only experience with COVID was through the shots. Overall, the authors think that the COVID shots make good T- cell memories that last a long time and are ready to fight off any version of the COVID virus. They say that people who get the shots should be protected from severe forms of COVID even if they come across a version of COVID that the current shots don’t guard against very well. Finally, the author says that the shots seem to give T-memories that are strong enough to last a really long time. It seems like the shots make sure that your body will remember how to fight COVID for a long period of time. The authors did not look at how much protection the shots gave against actually getting sick with the various versions of coronavirus. Also, the study only included a small group of people who already had COVID- 1 9 and were chosen based on the fact that they had a certain kind of reaction to the shots, so it isn’t clear how well their experiences would apply to most people who receive the shots nowadays. Additionally, the scientists didn’t check how well T-memory cells from people with COVID-shots would recognize newer versions of Sars-cov-2 that haven’t yet been identified in humans."
"Genes with the potential to cause tumors and cancer are commonly called oncogenes . One example of an oncogene encodes for a protein called MYC and many tumors contain high levels of this protein . MYC is a transcription factor and studies of aggressive tumors suggested that , like most other transcription factors , MYC binds to and regulates the activity of a small number of genes in tumors . However , other studies went on to show that MYC actually binds to thousands of genes and somehow only regulates a subset of them during tumor development . Lorenzin et al . set out to understand how this process works by generating human cells in which the concentration of MYC protein could be altered . In the experiments , the concentration was varied from normal healthy levels to the high levels found in aggressive tumors . The amount of MYC bound to genes and the extent to which it activated the genes inside these cells was also measured . Lorenzin et al . found that increasing MYC levels from normal to tumor-specific levels did not affect MYC binding at genes where the transcription factor was already strongly bound in normal cells . Rather , MYC binding increased only at genes that were weakly bound in normal cells . Consistent with this observation , only genes at which MYC was weakly bound in normal cells were activated by increasing MYC levels . This observation suggests that increasing the concentration of MYC protein from normal to tumor-specific levels “fills up” previously empty binding sites around these genes with the transcription factor . Lorenzin et al . also used mathematical modeling to understand how the concentrations of MYC in normal and tumor cells might explain how MYC behaves in cells . Together , the results imply that the MYC transcription factor regulates distinct sets of genes in normal and tumor cells according to how much MYC is present . Further studies may show that the altered regulation of a tumor-specific set of genes is important for tumor development and could use this new information to identify new targets for treating MYC-driven tumors ."," When there is too much of the ""MYC"" gene in cells, it can cause cancer. To figure out what happens when there is extra ""MYX"" in cells, researchers studied how well the ""extra"" works compared to normal amounts of ""MYCS"". They did this by looking at how well ""MYCL"" worked when they added different amounts of it to cells. Then, they looked at how much ""MYCH"" was being made in cells that already had lots of ""normal"" ""MYCI"", and saw that adding more ""MYCD"" didn't really change how much total ""MYCM"" was made. Finally, they figured out how much of each kind of ""Myc"" was actually doing anything useful in the cells by seeing how much changed when they took away either the ""normal amount"" or the ""too much"" of any kind of Myc. From this, they learned that having too much ""Myx"" doesn't mean you need more of everything else to make it work properly. It might just mean that certain things don't work very well anymore! This helps us understand better why having too little or too much Myc can cause problems like cancer. And maybe someday we can use this knowledge to help treat those problems! 1) What problem does having too high levels of Myx cause? 2) How do scientists know whether something is causing the problem? 3) Can we fix the problem somehow? If yes, how? If no, why not? 4) Why is it important to learn more about this problem? Is it going to hurt me or someone I know? 5) Are there ways to prevent or stop the problem from happening? If so, what are they? 6) Will knowing more about the problem help us come up with ways to solve it? If not, why isn't it worth solving?"
"In Canada , tuberculosis disproportionately affects the Inuit , a group of indigenous people inhabiting the Arctic regions . Canada is aiming to eliminate tuberculosis among the Inuit by 2030 . One way to help stop transmission and prevent future outbreaks is to trace how and where the disease spreads using DNA sequencing . This information can then be used by public health organizations to identify possible interventions . Typically , the DNA of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis – Mycobacterium tuberculosis , or Mtb for short – is sequenced 50–100 times and a consensus DNA sequence is then generated for each patient from this data . These consensus DNA sequences are then compared to help piece together who infected whom . Recently , scientists have realized that the bacteria a person is infected with may have different DNA sequences due to people being infected with more than one bacterium or the bacterium developing variations in its genome after the infection . However , current DNA sequencing practices may miss these differences , making it harder to trace how the disease spreads . Now , Lee et al . show that sequencing the DNA of Mtb from an infected person 500–1000 times ( i . e . ∼10-20 times more than usual ) makes it easier to detect genetic differences and determine how tuberculosis spreads . This approach , also known as ‘deep sequencing’ , was used to analyze DNA samples of Mtb collected from about 50 people during an outbreak of tuberculosis in 2011-2012 , which had previously undergone standard DNA sequencing . This deep sequencing approach identified a ‘super-spreading event’ where one person had likely transmitted tuberculosis to up to 17 others during the outbreak . Lee et al . found that most of these people had visited the same ‘gathering houses’ which are social venues in the community . Implementing targeted public health interventions at these sites may help stop future outbreaks . To fully understand how useful this method will be for tracking the spread of tuberculosis , deep and routine sequencing will need to be compared against each other in different settings and outbreaks . Furthermore , the approach used in this study may be useful for tracking the transmission of other infectious diseases ."," Researchers wanted to know why certain types of tubercle bacilli cause more severe illness than others. They studied the genetic makeup of 52 people who got sick with tubercles in Canada. Each person’ s tuberculate bacili were taken from their bodies and broken down into tiny pieces of DNA. Then, the DNA was put back together like a puzzle. When the researchers looked at the puzzles, they saw that some people had tuberclas that matched a special type of tubercule bacille called Mj. Some of the Mjs were really good at making more MJs, while other MJs weren’t. The researchers think that studying the MJ genes helped them learn which MJs were best at making copies of themselves. Understanding this might help doctors come up with better treatments for tubercules. The study showed that looking at the full set of genes in someone’s tuberacle bacilla can tell doctors which ones are most likely to spread around and hurt people. This knowledge could help doctors choose the right medicines to treat people with those specific types of bacilles. Looking at the genes of tuberkula bacillas could also help scientists learn more about how different kinds of tuberekulas spread and how to stop them. That could help with lots of different kinds or diseases! Scientists call the kind of gene study the researchers did here ""deep sequencing."" It lets them look at much bigger pieces of the puzzle than they normally would be able to. Doing this kind of study takes a lot of computer power and time, but it gives scientists a lot more information about the genes in things like tuberklas. The more information they have, the easier it is to figure out how things work! The researchers hope their study will help them and other scientists learn how to fight tubercular diseases better."
"Our bodies are home to lots of microorganisms , many of which are found throughout the gut . Gut microbes play important roles in human health , where they cooperate with our own cells to develop the immune system , synthesize essential vitamins , and help to absorb nutrients . When the cooperation between our own cells and the gut microbes fails , the microbial community within the gut can become a source of infection , sometimes leading to life-threatening diseases . Healthy individuals typically have many different types gut microbes , whereas people with poor health , or older individuals , will often have less diverse and a higher percentage of disease-causing microbes . For example , African turquoise killifish only live a few months , during which the composition of their gut microbes undergoes dramatic changes . While young fish harbor highly diverse microbial communities , older fish have less diverse communities and more microbes associated with disease . Until now , it was not known whether manipulating the gut composition could affect the aging process . By using the killifish as a model for their study , Smith et al . revealed that gut microbes affect how the fish survived and aged . When the guts of middle-aged fish were colonized with microbes transferred from younger fish , the older fish lived longer and were more active later in life . These fish also maintained a more diverse microbial community throughout their adulthood and shared key microbes with young fish – possibly associated with the improved health benefits . These results suggest that controlling the composition of the gut microbes can improve health and increase life span . The model system used in this study could provide new ways to manipulate the gut microbial community and gain key insights into how the gut microbes affect aging . Manipulating gut microbes to resemble a community found in young individuals could be a strategy to delay the onset of age-related diseases ."," Scientists wanted to know if the ""bad"" germs living inside of you can make your body break down faster. They did this experiment on tiny fish that live less than a month. First, the fish got rid of all their bad germs by giving them medicine. Then, the good germs from another fish were put back inside of them. Some of the good bacteria came from young fish and some came from older fish. The fish who got the good bugs from young ones lived longer than the others! Researchers think that getting rid of the ""old"" germ that makes you sick might help people live longer too! They also figured out what kinds of germs were making the fish sick. Hopefully, this will help doctors find ways to keep people healthy longer! Science!

"Living cells have a surrounding membrane that largely insulates the space inside from that outside . Yet signals from outside of the cell can still influence how that cell behaves . One way this can happen is via small molecules called ligands binding to proteins embedded in the membrane and triggering a cascade of reactions inside the cell . Studying this kind of protein-ligand interaction is important for many aspects of biology . However , such studies typically require that the ligand be first labeled in some way , which is time-consuming , costly and may alter how the ligand behaves . As such , there is a need for alternative ways to measure ligands binding to proteins in membranes . The fact that the two sides of a membrane are insulated from each other means that they can store electrical charges . The ability to store charges is called capacitance . Theory predicts that it should be possible to detect a change in capacitance when a ligand binds to a membrane protein . Yet , though the theoretical basis of this hypothesis has been widely accepted , it had not been tested experimentally until now . Burtscher et al . chose to focus on a membrane protein called the serotonin transporter because a large number of its ligands had already been characterized . Experiments with human cells that expressed this transporter confirmed that the binding of a ligand was indeed detectable as a change in membrane capacitance . Burtscher et al . also detected a brief electrical current across the membrane that is predicted to occur when the capacitance changes . Ligand binding studies are especially important in therapeutics , as many drugs rely on blocking specific signaling pathways in diseased cells . As these capacitance recordings show precise real-time measurements , they could be used for drug screening in the future , all without the need to label the ligands ."," Scientists want to know what happens inside living cells when drugs attach themselves to special proteins on the outside of the cell. To answer this question, scientists need to figure out how the attachment affects the behavior of the proteins. One way to tell if a drug attached to a cell protein is by watching how the protein moves. But it’s hard to see how proteins move because the proteINS ARE SO SMALL! Electrical signals can help us watch how proteinstransfer charges back and forth across the cell membrane. By looking at these electrical signals, scientists can learn whether a drug has attached to the cell protein. In this article, scientists used electrical signals to watch how a drug attaches to a special protein on the surface of a cell. They could watch because the drug caused big changes in how fast the electrical signals moved. That means the drug changed the way the protein worked. Because the scientists knew the name of the protein they were watching, they could conclude that the drug probably attached to that protein. This tells us something interesting about how the drug works inside the cell! And now we know that we can use electrical signals like this to learn more about how drugs work inside cells. That’s pretty cool! And it’ll help doctors figure out better ways to treat diseases. Yay science! Science yay! Science! Science!!! NOM NOM NOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mmmmmmmm. Delicious science.

"Our brains contain billions of neurons , which are continually producing electrical signals to relay information around the brain . Yet most of our knowledge of how the brain works comes from studying the activity of one neuron at a time . Recently , studies of multiple neurons have shown that they tend to be active together in short bursts called “up” states , which are followed by periods in which they are less active called “down” states . When we are sleeping or under a general anesthetic , the neurons may be completely silent during down states , but when we are awake the difference in activity between the two states is usually less extreme . However , it is still not clear how the neurons generate these patterns of activity . To address this question , Stringer et al . studied the activity of neurons in the brains of awake and anesthetized rats , mice and gerbils . The experiments recorded electrical activity from many neurons at the same time and found a wide range of different activity patterns . A computational model based on these data suggests that differences in the degree to which some neurons suppress the activity of other neurons may account for this variety . Increasing the strength of these inhibitory signals in the model decreased the fluctuations in electrical activity across entire areas of the brain . Further analysis of the experimental data supported the model’s predictions by showing that inhibitory neurons – which act to reduce electrical activity in other neurons – were more active when there were fewer fluctuations in activity across the brain . The next step following on from this work would be to develop ways to build computer models that can mimic the activity of many more neurons at the same time . The models could then be used to interpret the electrical activity produced by many different kinds of neuron . This will enable researchers to test more sophisticated hypotheses about how the brain works ."," When we sense something, our brain needs to decide whether the sensation comes from inside our body or outside in the environment. It uses special cells called inhibitory interneurons to compare the strengths of different signals coming from inside versus outside the brain. Interneurons send out signals that cancel out other signals. By doing this, the brain decides whether a sensation comes mostly from inside or outside. Scientists studied how interneuron signals work together in rats and mice. They found that interneurones worked differently depending on whether the animal was sleeping or awake. When the animals were asleep, interneurone signals cancelled out most of the signals from outside the cell. When they were awake, however, interneuorne signals cancelled much less of the outside signals. This means that the animals' brains paid closer attention to signals from the outside world when they were asleep. This helps the brain figure out whether a feeling comes from outside or inside the body. The scientists also saw that interneurone signals were stronger when the animals slept. This shows that interneurs work harder when we sleep. Sleeping may help us feel sensations better because the brain pays close attention to the feelings coming from outside. The authors think that this may be why we dream! They hope to learn more about how interneuros work by studying more animals. Then maybe they can tell us why we sleep and why we have dreams! Maybe they can even teach us ways to feel sensions better! That would be really cool! For example, we could feel vibrations from far away planets! Or we could hear whispers from ghosts! Or smell smells from outer space! Who knows? Anything is possible! Yay!!!

"Ageing happens to us all , and as the cabaret singer Maurice Chevalier pointed out , ""old age is not that bad when you consider the alternative"" . Yet , the growing ageing population of most developed countries presents challenges to healthcare systems and government finances . For many older people , long periods of ill health are part of the end of life , and so a better understanding of ageing could offer the opportunity to prolong healthy living into old age . Ageing is complex and takes a long time to study – a lifetime in fact . This makes it difficult to discern its causes , among the countless possibilities based on an individual’s genes , behaviour or environment . While thousands of regions in an individual’s genetic makeup are known to influence their risk of different diseases , those that affect how long they will live have proved harder to disentangle . Timmers et al . sought to pinpoint such regions , and then use this information to predict , based on their DNA , whether someone had a better or worse chance of living longer than average . The DNA of over 500 , 000 people was read to reveal the specific ‘genetic fingerprints’ of each participant . Then , after asking each of the participants how long both of their parents had lived , Timmers et al . pinpointed 12 DNA regions that affect lifespan . Five of these regions were new and had not been linked to lifespan before . Across the twelve as a whole several were known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease , smoking-related cancer or heart disease . Looking at the entire genome , Timmers et al . could then predict a lifespan score for each individual , and when they sorted participants into ten groups based on these scores they found that top group lived five years longer than the bottom , on average . Many factors beside genetics influence how long a person will live and our lifespan cannot be read from our DNA alone . Nevertheless , Timmers et al . had hoped to narrow down their search and discover specific genes that directly influence how quickly people age , beyond diseases . If such genes exist , their effects were too small to be detected in this study . The next step will be to expand the study to include more participants , which will hopefully pinpoint further genomic regions and help disentangle the biology of ageing and disease ."," Researchers investigated the causes of lifespin in 1million parents. They discovered several new ways that genes affect how long people live. Some of these effects were caused by small changes in the way that certain genes are turned on or off. Other effects came from big changes in how certain genes worked. The researchers also learned that having certain diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s disease, or cancer reduced the chance that people lived longer. Finally, the researchers figured out how well a person would likely live based on how closely related they were to someone who died young or old. Overall, the scientists think that studying how genes affected lifespain could help doctors figure out better ways to treat diseases that cause people to die earlier. They also think that looking at how genes change the way people act and feel could help them learn more about how aging works. The scientists hope that their discoveries will lead to new ideas for treating illnesses and improving health. The next steps should include figuring out exactly how the genes that were found affect lifesping and seeing if drugs could be made to turn those genes on or of. Also, it would be good to know if there are things that people could do themselves to change how those genes work. For example, maybe eating healthy food or exercising regularly could keep those genes working the way they should. That kind of information could tell people how to stay healthy longer. Another thing to look into would be to see if there were other genes that didn’t get mentioned in this study that also play a part in how long a person lives. Doing more research on those kinds of things could help people live longer and healthier lives. The bottom line is that scientists found some ways that certain parts of your DNA could affect how likely you are to live a long life. They think that learning more about those parts of DNA could help come up with ways to make people live even longer."
"The immune system uses antibodies to fight microbes that cause disease . White blood cells pump antibodies into the bloodstream , and these antibodies latch onto bacteria and viruses , targeting them for destruction . But sometimes , the immune system gets it wrong . In autoimmune diseases , white blood cells mistakenly make antibodies that target the body's own tissues . Detecting these 'autoantibodies' in the blood can help doctors to diagnose autoimmune diseases . But the identities and targets of many autoantibodies remain unknown . In one rare disease , called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS-1 ) , a faulty gene makes the immune system much more likely to make autoantibodies . People with this disease can develop an autoimmune response against many different healthy organs . Although APS-1 is rare , some of the autoantibodies made by individuals with the disease are the same as the ones in more common autoimmune diseases , like type 1 diabetes . Therefore , investigating the other autoantibodies produced by individuals with APS-1 could reveal the autoantibodies driving other autoimmune diseases . Autoantibodies bind to specific regions of healthy proteins , and one way to identify them is to use hundreds of thousands of tiny viruses in a technique called proteome-wide programmable phage-display , or PhIP-Seq . Each phage carries one type of protein segment . When mixed with blood serum from a patient , the autoantibodies stick to the phages that carry the target proteins for that autoantibody . These complexes can be isolated using biochemical techniques . Sequencing the genes of these phages then reveals the identity of the autoantibodies’ targets . Using this technique , Vazquez et al successfully pulled 23 known autoantibodies from the serum of patients with APS-1 . Then , experiments to search for new targets began . This revealed many new autoantibodies , targeting proteins found only in specific tissues . They included one that targets a protein found on cells in the gut , and another that targets a protein found on egg cells in the ovaries . Matching the PhIP-Seq data to patient symptoms confirmed that these new antibodies correlate with the features of specific autoimmune diseases . For example , patients with antibodies that targeted the gut protein were more likely to have gut symptoms , while patients with antibodies that targeted the egg cell protein were more likely to have problems with their ovaries . Further investigations using PhIP-Seq could reveal the identities of even more autoantibodies . This might pave the way for new antibody tests to diagnose autoimmune diseases and identify tissues at risk of damage . This could be useful not only for people with APS-1 , but also for more common autoimmune diseases that target the same organs ."," Researchers have found new clues about what triggers some people to develop autoimmunities. They did this by looking closely at samples taken from patients who had a particular kind of auto immune disorder called APS-1. They looked at the samples using special techniques that let them figure out exactly which proteins the person makes. They compared the proteins made by healthy people versus people with the autoimmunes disorder. By doing this, they figured out that some of the proteases (which break down proteins) made by people with this disorder were different from the ones made by most people without the disorder. Then, they checked to see if these differences matched up with things that doctors noticed about the people with autoimmuniess. They found that some people who had the disorder had antibodties to proteases that were different than usual. And they found that these people tended to get sicknesses that match up with the protease differences. This helps researchers learn more about why some people get autoimmunitis and how to treat it. It also shows that looking carefully at proteins can give important clues into why some illnesses happen. That is really helpful! Now, researchers can look for these proteases to see which ones might be causing other kinds of auto immunity. If they find more, it could help doctors come up with better ways to treat people with these illnesses. Yay! Science is awesome! 💥👊🎓🔬🧫🦠🤖🌐📈🏆🗺️🕵️‍♀️𝓡𝒾𝑂𝔼𝙁𝚪𝛽𝜃𝞄𝨅𝩰𝳋𝱃😯🙀🚶‍♂️𞍂🐹🥴🛸‍♀‍🪢🣯𝗮𝘁🇭🍲🫁𞓿🖥️𓅻🆕🟉🩸🅷🢂𞕊𝕋🡕𝖙🞂"
"The rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria is challenging clinicians , and some infections are now resistant to almost all of the drugs that are currently available . Some types of bacteria – such as mycobacteria , which include the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy – can only acquire antibiotic resistance from mutations that alter their existing genes . The process by which bacteria develop resistance to multiple drugs is generally viewed as a stepwise accumulation of different mutations . However , the role of individual mutations that increase a bacterium’s resistance to multiple antibiotics has not been fully explored . Gomez , Kaufmann-Malaga et al . exposed bacteria from the species Mycobacterium smegmatis , a cousin of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis , to a mixture of relatively low concentrations of different antibiotics that should kill the bacteria relatively slowly . Hundreds of small bacteria cultures were grown in parallel , and only a fraction of them developed antibiotic-resistant members . Gomez , Kaufmann-Malaga et al . identified mutations in these bacteria that unexpectedly gave the bacteria resistance to several unrelated classes of antibiotics . Individual mutants carried single mutations in different components of the ribosome , a complex molecular machine that helps to build proteins inside cells . As well as increasing their resistance to antibiotics , these mutations also reduced the growth rate of the bacteria . This meant that when the bacteria were grown in an antibiotic-free environment they survived less well than non-mutant bacteria . However , the mutations gave the bacteria an advantage in environments that contained many different antibiotics , as they could more easily develop mutations that made them more resistant to other drugs . Thus , the mutant bacteria can serve as stepping-stones toward the development of high-level resistance to multiple drugs . Further work will now explore whether this phenomenon occurs in a range of other bacterial species , including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis . While new antibiotics are desperately needed , a better understanding of how bacteria evolve the ability to resist the effects of antibiotics will help us to preserve the usefulness of existing and future drugs ."," Antibiograms are tests done to figure out how sensitive bacteria are to certain types of antibacterial agents. Scientists wanted to know if mutations affecting the structure of bacterial ribosomes might change how sensitive the bacteria are not just to one kind of antibiacidal agent, but to lots of different kinds. To answer this question, scientists looked at mutations already discovered in a type bacteria called Mycrobacterium Smegmatitis. They saw that some of these mutations changed the shape of the ribosme. Then, they put the bacteria with these mutated ribsomes into liquid with different kinds of antibiatics. Bacteria with mutated shapes of ribsome grew faster than ones with regular shaped ribsome. That means the mutations helped the bacteria survive even though they were exposed to antibioticals. But, the mutated bacteria still grew slower than the ones without any antibiotials around. So, the ribsomeshape changing mutations gave the bacteria an advantage in surviving antibiotical exposure, but not enough of an advantage to let them grow really quickly. Also, the researchers noticed that the ribsome shaping mutations seemed to help the bacteria become more resistant to lots and lots of diffrent kinds of antbiotics. Finally, the scientists figured out that the mutation causing the ribsoame to have an odd shape also caused the bacteria to be less sensitive to a special kind of antbiosical called katG. And, they found that adding another mutation to the bacteria fixed the problem with the katG gene. That meant that the weirdly shaped ribsomelike mutation actually made the bacteria more sensitive to katG, and adding back the right copy of the kat G gene fixed that problem. So the bottom line is that mutations causing ribsomesto have strange shapes can help bacteria survive when exposed to lotsand lots of diffeent kinds ofantibiotics. But those mutations come with a price: they also make the bacteria less sensitive tot hekatG antibiotal. Luckily, you can fix that problem by giving the bacteria a new copy ofthe katGgen."
"In the body , cancer cells can rely on different nutrients than normal cells , and they can use these nutrients in a different way . What cancer cells consume also depends on what is available in their immediate environment . In a tumor , cells grab nutrients from the ‘interstitial’ fluid that surrounds them , but what is present in this liquid may vary within tumors arising in different locations . Understanding what nutrients are ‘on the menu’ in specific tumors would help to target diseased cells while sparing healthy ones , but this knowledge has been difficult to obtain . To investigate this , Sullivan et al . used a technique called mass spectrometry to measure the amounts of 120 nutrients present in the interstitial fluid of mouse pancreas and lung tumors . Different levels of nutrients were found in the two types of tumors , and analyses showed that what was present in the interstitial fluid depended on the type of cancer cells , where the tumor was located , and what the animals ate . This suggests that cancer cells may have different needs because they are limited in what they have access to . It remains to be seen whether the nutrients levels found in mouse tumors are the same as those in humans . Armed with this knowledge , it may then be possible to feed cancer cells grown in the laboratory with the nutrient menu that they would have access to in the body . This could help identify new cancer treatments ."," Cancer cells need energy to grow and survive. They get this energy by taking up glucose from the surrounding environment and breaking it down into smaller building blocks called metabolates. Scientists wanted to know what kinds of metaboltes are inside tumours and how much of each kind there is. They did this by measuring the amount of different types of metablotes in liquid from inside the tumour and outside the tumours. They found out that there are lots of different metabolts inside the liquid from the tumors and that the amounts of some of these metabolits are lower than you would expect based on how much there is in the normal fluids around the tumore. They think that maybe the reason for this is that some of the metabolots are being used up faster than usual by things like immune cells that come into contact with the tumores. They also want to figure out why some of th metabolte levels are different depending on where the tumorse are located in the body and whether this affects how well the tumorus respond to treatment. They plan to do this by changing the food that the mices eat to see if that makes a difference. They want to know this because understanding how the metboltes work inside tumors could help doctors come up with better ways to treat cancer patients. This research was done using mouse tumors, but it could eventually help us learn how to make better medicines for people with cancer. It took a lot of hard work and many different tools to collect and analyze all of the data. The researchers used special chemicals to break apart the tumortissues and separate the liquids from inside and outside of the tumord from the restof the tissue. Then they used really sensitive machines to count how many of each type of chemical there were in the liqudfrom inside andoutside of the tuomrs. Finally, they used computers to look at the data and draw conclusions about what they found. Overall, the researchers learned a lot about the chemicals inside and outsidethe tumors.

"On average , in Europe , men can currently expect to live till the age of 75 and women until they are 82 . But what will their lifespans be in the next decades ? Reliable answers to this question are essential to help governments plan for future health care and social security costs . While medical improvements are likely to further extend lifespans , lifestyle factors can result in temporal distortions of this trend . Yet , most estimates of future life expectancy fail to consider changing lifestyles , as they only use past mortality trends in their calculations . This can make these projections unreliable: for example , increases in smoking rates among Northern and Western European men led to stagnating male life expectancies in the 1950s and 1960s , but these picked up again after smoking declined . The same pattern is showing for women , except it is lagging as they took up smoking later than men . Based simply on the extrapolation of past mortality trends , current projection models fail to consider the past and predicted modifications of life expectancy trends prompted by changing rates of health behaviours – such as increases followed by ( anticipated ) declines in alcohol consumption and obesity rates , similar to what was observed with smoking . To produce a more reliable forecast , Janssen et al . incorporated trends in smoking , obesity , and alcohol use into life expectancy projections for 18 European countries . The predictions suggest that life expectancy for women in these countries will increase from 83 . 4 years in 2014 to 92 . 8 years in 2065 . For men , it will also go up , from 78 . 3 to 90 . 5 years . In the future , this integrative approach may help to track the effects of health-behaviour related prevention policies on life expectancy , and allow scientists to account for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . In the meantime , these estimates are higher than those obtained using more traditional methods; they suggest that communities should start to adjust to the possibility of longer individual lifespans , and of larger numbers of elderly people in society ."," Smoking, drinking alcohol, and being overweight can shorten people’s lives. Using computer programs, researchers estimated how much these behaviors affect the number of years people live in 31 European countries. They found that if everyone stopped smoking, drinking, and gaining too much weight, women would likely live about nine more years and seven more years for males. If everyone did not smoke, drink, or gain too much extra weight, the difference between females and males living longest would decrease. Previous studies predicted that women would live almost ten years longer than men. Overall, the authors think that their method gives better predictions than previous methods. Their method takes into account that people who smoke die younger than nonsmokers. Also, their method assumes that the differences in how long women and men live will get smaller in time. Finally, the researchers say that their calculations assume that the trend of increasing life expectancies will continue in the coming decades. This means that people will live longer and longer. The authors believe that their estimates are reasonable. Other experts agree that smoking, excessive drinking, or becoming overweight reduce life expectancys. For instance, the World Health Organization says that “smoke-free laws, bans on tobacco advertising, and access to quitting assistance” save lives. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol Use states that “if you don’t drink, you won’t have an alcohol problem.”. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that losing weight reduces your risk of getting diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. All of these things mean that people live longer. Overall, the authors’ method seems good. People need to stop smoking, stop drinking too much, and lose weight to live longer! That sounds pretty good to me! I hope you enjoyed reading this article. Thank you for choosing to read my article. I appreciate your time. Have a great day!"
"All recommended treatments against malaria include a drug called artemisinin or some of its derivatives . However , there are concerns that Plasmodium falciparum , the parasite that causes most cases of malaria , will eventually develop widespread resistance to the drug . A strain of P . falciparum partially resistant to artemisinin was seen in Cambodia in 2008 , and it has since spread across Southeast Asia . The resistance appears to be frequently linked to a mutation known as pfk13 C580Y . Southeast Asia and Amazonia are considered to be hotspots for antimalarial drug resistance , and the pfk13 C580Y mutation was detected in the South American country of Guyana in 2010 . To examine whether the mutation was still circulating in this part of the world , Mathieu et al . collected and analyzed 854 samples across Guyana between 2016 and 2017 . Overall , 1 . 6% of the samples had the pfk13 C580Y mutation , but this number was as high as 8 . 8% in one region . Further analyses revealed that the mutation in Guyana had not spread from Southeast Asia , but that it had occurred in Amazonia independently . To better understand the impact of the pfk13 C580Y mutation , Mathieu et al . introduced this genetic change into non-resistant parasites from a country neighbouring Guyana . As expected , the mutation made P . falciparum highly resistant to artemisinin , but it also slowed the growth rate of the parasite . This disadvantage may explain why the mutation has not spread more rapidly through Guyana in recent years . Artemisinin and its derivatives are always associated with other antimalarial drugs to slow the development of resistance; there are concerns that reduced susceptibility to artemisinin leads to the parasites becoming resistant to the partner drugs . Further research is needed to evaluate how the pfk13 C580Y mutation affects the parasite’s response to the typical combination of drugs that are given to patients ."," Malaria is a serious illness caused by parasites that live inside red blood cells. There are medicines called ACTs that cure malaria. Some types of ACTs contain a special ingredient called arteminisin. Arteminisn works by attacking the malaria parasite. Sometimes, the malarial parasite becomes resistant to artemensisin. This happens when the parasite finds ways to avoid being attacked by arteminsin. Scientists have found out that a certain kind of malaria called Plasmosium falcaprum has changed in some parts of Africa. This change lets the malara parasite resist artemnisin. Researchers think that this change happened around the same time that arteminusin started being used in Africa. To learn more about this problem, scientists took samples from people who had malaria in Guyanna. They also grew copies of the malria parasite in the lab. Then, they tested how sensitive the lab copies of maleria were to artemsiusin. Finally, they figured out how the malera parasite changed so that it could resist artemsinusin. They hope that this knowledge will help doctors find new ways to treat malaria that will last longer. This Summary was generated using language provided by https://www.langdetect.com/.

Original Text: Local emergence of Plasmoidium falcparnum k 13C5 80 Y mutants Associated with in Vitro Artesunate Resistance. Abstract: Antimalarials drug resistance have historically arise through converge de nov mutations Plasmodeum falcpornum parasites in Southeastern Asia and south America. For the last decade in southeastern Asian countries, artemissinins, the core components of first‐line antmalarials therapies, have experienced delayer parasite clears associated with multiple pfcrt mutations, primarily CVIET (K142T5). We report here that mutants pfcrit have emerged independently of Guyana, with genomics analysis indicating evolutionary origins distinct from southeastern Asia. Mutant pfcirt (C508Y or 530T) were detected in 5.6% of samples (14 of 85) collected in 3 geographically distant regions of Guyama in 014"
"Inside human and other animal cells , filaments known as microtubules help support the shape of the cell and move proteins to where they need to be . Defects in microtubules may lead to disease . For example , genetic mutations affecting a microtubule component called TUBB4A cause a rare brain disease in humans known as H-ABC . Individuals with H-ABC display many symptoms including abnormal walking , speech defects , impaired swallowing , and several cognitive defects . Abnormalities in several areas of the brain , including the cerebellum and striatum contribute to these defects . . In these structures , the neurons that carry messages around the brain and their supporting cells , known as oligodendrocytes , die , which causes these parts of the brain to gradually waste away . At this time , there are no therapies available to treat H-ABC . Furthermore , research into the disease has been hampered by the lack of a suitable “model” in mice or other laboratory animals . To address this issue , Sase , Almad et al . generated mice carrying a mutation in a gene which codes for the mouse equivalent of the human protein TUBB4A . Experiments showed that the mutant mice had similar physical symptoms to humans with H-ABC , including an abnormal walking gait , poor coordination and involuntary movements such as twitching and reduced reflexes . H-ABC mice had smaller cerebellums than normal mice , which was consistent with the wasting away of the cerebellum observed in individuals with H-ABC . The mice also lost neurons in the striatum and cerebellum , and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord . Furthermore , the mutant TUBB4A protein affected the behavior and formation of microtubules in H-ABC mice . The findings of Sase , Almad et al . provide the first mouse model that shares many features of H-ABC disease in humans . This model provides a useful tool to study the disease and develop potential new therapies ."," Scientists created a special kind of mouse that carries a genetic error in a specific part of a gene called TUBBA4A. This mistake makes the mouse get a disease called “Hypopmyelination of basal ganglia and cerebellem” (H-ABCD). Researchers looked closely at the brains of these mice at several stages of life. When the mice are very young, there are less OLIGODENDROCYTE PROGENITOR CELLS (OLPs) in the brains than in healthy mice. As the mices grow older, even more OLPs die. There are also fewer NEURONS in the area of the brain called the STRIATUM in the diseased mice than in the healthy ones. Finally, the mises with the disease have smaller brains than the healthy mises. The authors conclude that the mistakes in the part of the gene called “TUBBA” cause the disease H-ADBC by affecting both OLP and neuron cells. The author think that this discovery could help doctors figure out ways to treat this disease. The word “neurodegenerative” means that the disease causes nerve cells to slowly disappear. The words “leukodistrophy” mean that the nerves in the body cannot communicate because the fatty coverings around the nerves are falling apart. The phrase “progressive motor dysfunctions” means the person’s ability to use their muscles becomes worse and worse. The term “dementia” refers to a problem thinking clearly. The last paragraph explains why the scientists made this mouse and what they did to it. They made the mouse by putting a copy of the bad gene into the mouse’s DNA. Then they looked at the mouse to see what happened. The scientists hope that studying this mouse will teach them how to fix the disease. They think that fixing the disease would involve figuring out how to repair the mistakes they put into the gene."
"Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect , affecting nearly 1 in 100 children born . It can involve a weak heart , narrowed arteries , narrowed heart valves , or the main arteries of the heart switching places . These conditions can be fatal if untreated and often need surgery to correct . The mother’s blood sugar levels during pregnancy can have a large effect on how likely the baby is to have congenital heart disease . If a pregnant woman has poorly controlled diabetes with rapidly fluctuating sugar levels , she may be at a higher risk of having a child with the condition . High sugar levels in the mother’s blood make the baby up to five times more likely to have congenital heart disease . It has been difficult to find out exactly how sugar levels interfere with heart development because diabetes can affect the fetus in many ways . Nakano et al . used stem cells and experiments in pregnant mice with diabetes to hone in on how high sugar levels affect the fetus’s heart development . First , heart cells were grown from human stem cells , and exposed to high levels of glucose in a dish . This revealed a new mechanism for how high sugar levels affect heart formation: the cells created too many nucleotides , the building blocks of molecules such as DNA . It turns out that high glucose levels boosted a chemical process in the cell known as the pentose phosphate pathway . Some of the products of this pathway are nucleotides . This made the cells divide rapidly , but did not allow them to mature well compared with cells exposed to normal levels of sugar . In another experiment , Nakano et al . found similar results in pregnant diabetic mice . The heart cells in mouse fetuses also divided quickly but matured slowly when exposed to high sugar levels . An estimated 60 million women at an age to have children have diabetes . These new findings help us to understand why and how these women are more likely to have children with congenital heart disease , and further study will hopefully lead to a better way to prevent this condition ."," Glucose is a kind of sugar that provides energy to living things. During pregnancy, women who have diabetes have too much glucoses in their blood. This condition might harm the growth of baby's heart. Researchers studied how glucosed affected the growth and development of heart cells taken from human babies. They discovered that having too much of gluces in the blood blocked the growth, development, and working properly of the heart cells. They also found that blocking the way glucse provided energy to the heart cell helped the cells develop normally. Therefore, doctors should pay attention to pregnant woman's blood gluce level because it might affect the growing of baby’s heart cells and eventually the baby’ heart health. If you are pregnant, please follow your doctor’s advice regarding your blood gluce level. If necessary, you can ask your doctor if you need to take medicine to control your blood sugar level. Please do exercises regularly and maintain good eating habits. Do not forget to visit your doctor regularly. Your doctor will check your blood pressure and measure your blood sugce level. Together, both of you can find the best treatment method suitable for you. Remember, taking care of yourself and your baby is very important!

"Most plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil via structures called roots . The shape , size , and structure of a plant's root system can change over its lifetime as the plant responds to changes in their local environment . For example , if water is scarce , a plant may develop a very deep root system that is more efficient at capturing water . Understanding how root systems respond to environmental cues may help us to identify the genes and processes involved . In this study , Rellán-Álvarez et al . report a new live-imaging platform for analyzing root architecture and its regulation . This platform is called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( or GLO-Roots for short ) and uses ‘luminescent’ markers that allow growing roots to be visualized when plants are grown in thin , soil-filled , transparent pots . GLO-Roots can track the growth of the plant roots as well as the activity of genes that respond to environmental stress . Rellán-Álvarez et al . developed a software tool called GLO-RIA ( GLO-Roots Image Analysis ) to analyze the resulting images . GLO-RIA performs several different types of image analysis , including one that detects the position , length , and direction of roots , as well as their shape and depth . Rellán-Álvarez et al . tested the GLO-Roots techniques in various ways , for example , by analyzing the effects that different conditions have on the growth of the roots of the model plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana . Depriving the plants of a nutrient called phosphorous caused the roots to grow more horizontally than when phosphorus is plentiful , presumably to allow the plants to expand their search for phosphate in the upper layers of the soil , where this nutrient is usually more abundant . On the other hand , a shortage of water caused the roots to grow more vertically to access water stored deeper in the soil . GLO-Roots can also be used to measure the water content of soil at different depths and how this influences the architecture of the root . Further experiments on tomato plants and a grass species called Brachypodium distachyon revealed the different architectures of their root systems . Rellán-Álvarez et al . propose that this system could be used to study the roots of other plant species in a variety of environmental conditions . This will provide a more detailed understanding of the ways that different plants adapt in response to changes in their environment .","Plants use their roots to anchor themselves in the ground and absorb water and nutrients. Because roots live underground, researchers have difficulty observing them directly. As a result, most knowledge about roots comes from digging up plants and examining their roots afterward. Unfortunately, this method causes stress to the plant and sometimes kills it. Recently, scientists have learned how to observe roots while they are still inside the ground by using special cameras that can see light produced deep below the surface. Now, researchers want to learn more about what roots look like inside the soil and how they react to changes in their surroundings. To do so, they created a device called GLO‐Roots that lets them watch roots growing in real time. They tested GLO−Roots by looking at how tomato plants responded to being touched on their leaves. Touching the leaves caused the roots to grow faster and in a straight line toward where they were touched. Scientists think that this reaction might happen because touching the leaf releases chemicals that tell the roots something has happened aboveground. Next, the researchers wanted to know if GLO − Roots could be used to examine how roots react to microorganisms that live in the soil. They chose to focus on bacteria that live on plant roots and help them grow. The researchers infected tomato seedlings with bacteria and watched how the roots grew over time. The roots of the infected plants grew differently than the roots of healthy plants. Specifically, the roots bent away from the infection site. Lastly, the authors wanted to see if GRO‐Root could be modified to let scientists look at how roots respond to different kinds of chemicals in the surrounding soil. To accomplish this, they looked at how different varieties of wild lettuce seeds behaved when exposed to different amounts of salt in the growth medium. Wild lettuce grows best in sandy soils with low amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl), whereas saltier soils inhibit its growth. Indeed, the scientists saw that wild lettuces from areas with higher salinity grew longer roots than those from lower salinity areas. Together, these results suggest that GLO‑Roots can be used in many different ways to better understand how roots grow and respond to their environments."
"Cells respond to stressful conditions by changing which of their genes are switched on . Such stress-specific genes are typically switched off again when the conditions improve , but can remain primed and ready to be switched on again when needed . This phenomenon is known as “epigenetic transcriptional memory” and allows for a faster or stronger response to the same stress in the future . In fact , these memories can last for a long time , even after the cell divides many times . Inside cells , most of the DNA is wrapped tightly around proteins called histones . To activate – or transcribe – a gene , the DNA must be re-packaged to allow better access for specific proteins including the enzyme called RNA polymerase II . This repackaging involves a number of changes including chemical modification of the histone proteins . Genes that have been previously transcribed under stress are packaged in a different way so that they are poised and ready for the next time they are needed . However , the details of this process were not clear . Using yeast as a model , D'Urso et al . have dissected the changes that are responsible for priming genes to respond to future events . The yeast gene INO1 , which shows transcriptional memory , was studied in cells by characterizing the proteins bound at and around the gene and the histone modifications in the region . D'Urso et al . found that a protein called SfI1 bound to this gene only during transcriptional memory and that this binding was critical to start the phenomenon . Further experiments showed that transcriptional memory also required altering two protein complexes that normally bind to genes when they are switched on . One complex , which includes an enzyme that modifies histones , was altered so that the histones at the INO1 gene were marked in a unique way . The other complex was responsible for recruiting an inactive , poised form of RNA polymerase II to the gene , which allowed the gene to be activated when needed . In addition , D'Urso found that other genes that show transcriptional memory in yeast , as well as such genes in human cells , were also marked in the same ways . A future challenge will be to understand how different conditions in different organisms can lead to transcriptional memory . Further studies could also explore how this memory phenomenon is inherited and how it influences an organism’s fitness ."," When a yeast cell decides to turn on a certain gene, it stays turned on even after the trigger is removed. This happens because the cell remembers that the gene was once activated. How does this happen? Researchers studied a gene in yeasts whose product helps them survive in high salt environments. They found that the cell stores information about whether the gene is on or off inside the nucleium, the bag-like compartment inside the cell where the DNA is stored. There are several ways in which this information can be stored. One way is by having special proteins bind to the gene's DNA when it is on. Another way is to change the structure of the chromatin, the material made mostly of DNA and proteins that surrounds the DNA. Both of these things happened in the case of the yeast gene they looked at. If the gene stayed on, the chromosome changed its structure and special protein bound to the area. To find out why this happens, the researchers looked at the parts of the gene that seemed to be important. They saw that there was a sequence of letters in the DNA that told the cell to put the gene in the corner of the nucleum, close to the membrane that separates the nucleiom from the rest of the cell. They also saw that a protein, called Sfl, helped keep the gene on. Without Sfl the gene couldn't stay on. The researchers think that putting the gene near the edge of the nuclieom might help it remember to be on. They think that this happens because when the gene moves to the edge, it can easily get help from Sfl. Once the gene moved to the corner, it got help from both Sfl and something else that kept the gene from moving away from the edge. By looking at the yeasts gene, the scientists learned that changing the structure or adding special protections to a gene can tell the cell whether it should turn the gene off or leave it on."
"Injuries to the brain and spinal cord cause disability in millions of people worldwide . Physical rehabilitation can restore some muscle control and improve mobility in affected individuals . However , no current treatments provide long-term relief from the unwanted muscle contractions and spasms that affect as many as 78% of people with a spinal cord injury . These spasms can seriously hamper a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks and get around independently . A few treatments can help in the short term but have side effects; indeed while Botox injections are used to paralyse the muscle , these also reduce the chances of useful improvements . As such , better therapies for muscle spasms are needed; especially ones that reduce spasms in the arms . Rats with injuries to the spinal cord between their middle to lower back typically develop spasms in their legs or tail , and rat models have helped scientists begin to understand why these involuntary movements occur . Now , Kathe et al . report that cutting one specific pathway that connects the brain to the spinal cord in anesthetised rats leads to the development of spasms in the forelimbs as well . Several months after the surgery , the rats had spontaneous muscle contractions in their forelimbs and walked abnormally . Further experiments showed that some other neural pathways in the rats became incorrectly wired and hyperactive and that this resulted in the abnormal movements . Next , Kathe et al . asked whether using gene therapy to deliver a protein that is required for neural circuits to form between muscles and the spinal cord ( called neurotrophin-3 ) would stop the involuntary movements in the forelimbs . Delivering the gene therapy directly into the forelimb muscles of the disabled rats a day after their injury increased the levels of neurotrophin-3 in these muscles . Rats that received this treatment had fewer spasms and walked better than those that did not . Further experiments confirmed that this was because the rats’ previously hyperactive and abnormally wired neural circuits became more normal after the treatment . Together these results suggest that neurotrophin-3 might be a useful treatment for muscle spasms in people with spinal injury . There have already been preliminary studies in people showing that treatment with neurotrophin-3 is safe and well tolerated . Future studies are needed to confirm that it could be useful in humans ."," When the main nerves connecting the brain to the rest of the body are cut, it can lead not only to loss of movement, but also to spasm and stiffness in the limbs. This happens because the part of the brain above the neck still tries to send messages to the injured part of nerves below the neck, causing the muscles to contract even when the person wants to relax them. Scientists have been trying to figure out ways to fix this problem. They have found that giving a virus to the damaged area of the spine that makes the cells respond differently to the messages from the brain helps calm down the spasming muscles. This virus makes the muscles react more like they would if the connection between the brain and the spine wasn't hurt. Using this virus helped the rats walk around again more easily. The scientists think this method could be helpful for people too. Before using it on people, though, more research must be done to make sure it is safe and effective. That means finding out exactly how the virus works and making sure it doesn't harm the rts in any way. So far, the scientists know that the virus helps balance out the signals coming from the brains and the bodies better. They also know that it helps the muscles remember how to relax properly. And finally, they know that giving the virus to rats helps them walk around easier. More research still needs to happen before anyone gets to try this new kind of treatment. But right now, everyone should keep in mind that there is hope for people whose brains aren't talking to their bodies very well anymore! Maybe someday soon there will be a way to fix it! That would be great news for everyone who has ever fallen over or stumbled while walking, run into walls, dropped things, or had trouble doing everyday tasks because they couldn't hear what their bodies were telling them! Science is always looking for ways to make us healthier and happier. Sometimes it takes a really long time to find answers, but sometimes we get lucky and find them pretty quickly!"
"After the DNA in a gene has been transcribed into messenger RNA , portions of the mRNA called introns are removed , and the remaining stretches of mRNA , which are known as exons , are spliced together . Within eukaryotic cells , a process known as alternative splicing allows a single gene to encode for multiple protein variants by ensuring that some exons are included in the final , modified mRNA , while other exons are excluded . This modified mRNA is then translated into proteins . Eukaryotic cells also contain proteins that bind to RNA to regulate alternative splicing . These RNA-binding proteins are often found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells , and their involvement in splicing may be linked to other processes in the cell such as mRNA localization and translation . It has also become clear over the past two decades that certain types of RNA-binding proteins , including NOVA proteins , are only found in neurons , and that these proteins have been best characterized as alternative splicing regulators . Recent work has also suggested that they also have important roles in regulating neuronal activity and development , and that their actions in neuronal nuclei and cytoplasm might be coordinated . Now Eom et al . use the predictive power of a high throughput sequencing and crosslinking method termed HITS-CLIP to show that NOVA proteins can indirectly regulate cytoplasmic mRNA levels by regulating the process of alternative splicing in the nucleus to produce ‘cryptic’ exons in the brains of mice . The presence of these exons in the mRNA leads to the production of premature termination codons in the cytoplasm . These codons trigger a process called nonsense-mediated decay that involves identifying mRNA transcripts that contain nonsense mutations , and then degrading them . These cryptic exons were seen in mice missing the NOVA proteins , where they are expressed in abnormally high levels; in normal mice , these exons have not been seen before , hence they were termed ‘cryptic’ . Eom et al . also show that these cryptic exons are physiologically relevant by inducing epileptic seizures in mice . Following the seizures , they find that the NOVA proteins up-regulate and down-regulate the levels of different cryptic exons , leading to changes in the levels of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs , including proteins that inhibit further seizures . Overall the results indicate that , by controlling the production of various proteins in neurons , these previously unknown cryptic exons have important roles in the workings of the brain ."," Researchers discovered that a certain kind of protein called NOVA helps to decide whether or not to make copies of certain parts of a gene called ""exons"" into proteins, depending on where in the cell the gene is located. Some of these exons are normally skipped over when making copies of the gene, but NOVA makes sure that these exon parts get copied instead. Making extra copies of these special exons causes the cell to make fewer copies of another part of that same gene, which is important in keeping the amount of a protein made from that gene just right. This happens because the copy of the second part of this gene gets destroyed by something called nonsense mediator decay. This only happens when the gene copy is inside a tiny piece of the cell called the nucleus. Normally, most of the genes that contain these special types of exons do not happen to be inside the nuclei of the part where proteins are made. However, sometimes the gene moves into the part that makes proteins and needs to be destroyed by nonsense mediatory decay. The reason why the gene suddenly moves into this part of cell is because of sudden bursts of electricity inside the brain cells called seizures. Seizures also cause another kind of gene called Nova to move away from the part inside the cell where the gene usually stays. This movement allows the gene to stay inside the part with proteins long enough to be turned into a protein. Having too little of this protein can cause seizures, and having too much can cause mental disorders. Therefore, the right amount of this kind of protean is very important for the brain to work properly. It is still not known exactly how much of this special protein is safe for the body to have, but knowing more about the ways that the brain uses to decide how much to make will help doctors figure out safer ways to treat patients who have too much or too little."
"Sleep affects memory: if you do not sleep well after a learning task , chances are you will not be able to recall whatever you tried to learn earlier . This is seen in almost all animals ranging from the fruit fly Drosophila , to mice and humans . However , the precise details of how memory and sleep are connected remain unclear . Drosophila is an excellent model for teasing out the connections between memory and sleep . This is because its brain has a simple and well-studied memory region that contains a pair of nerve cells called the dorsal paired medial neurons . These neurons enable memories to be stored for the long term . Here , Haynes et al . asked whether these neurons can also affect sleep , and if so , how . The experiments show that the dorsal paired medial neurons promote sleep in fruit flies . The neurons release a signaling molecule called GABA , which is detected by a type of neighboring ‘mushroom body’ neuron that usually promotes wakefulness . This leads to increases in the levels of chloride ions in the mushroom body neurons , but no change in the levels of calcium ions and a molecule called cAMP , which indicates that GABA inhibits these cells . Flies that have lower levels of two receptor proteins that detect GABA sleep less than normal flies . Haynes et al . 's findings suggest that dorsal paired medial neurons deactivate their neighbors to promote sleep in fruit flies . This result was unexpected because current models of memory formation propose that dorsal paired medial neurons can activate the mushroom body neurons . Understanding how inhibiting mushroom body neurons influences memory will require researchers to reassess these models ."," Sleep helps people remember things, but scientists don't really know why. It turns out that there might be a connection between sleeping and remembering because some of the same parts of the brain are involved in both activities. Scientists already knew that a certain part of the fly's brain, called the mushroom bodys, helped them remember things. They also knew that another part of brain, the dorse paired median neurons, or DPM, helped the fly fall asleep. So, they looked to see if the DPM had anything to do with helping the fly remember things too. They found that the DMPs seemed to help the flies sleep by talking to another group of brain cells called the alpha' beta' neuron. When the DPA talked to the alpha 'beta', the flies slept more. Then, the scientists blocked the communication between the DPR and the alpha beta so the DRM couldn't talk to the DPT anymore. Without this communication, the flies didn't sleep very long. Finally, the scientist figured out that the alpha and beta neurons communicate with each other using chemicals called GABBA and GAPBA. When those chemicals weren't working, the fly wouldn't fall asleep! All of this means that the part of your brain that makes you feel tired might also be the part that helps you remember things later on. That's pretty cool! Now scientists know more about how sleeping and learning are related. And who knows? Maybe taking a nap will help you learn stuff faster! Just don' t fall asleep in class!......................,....,..,,.. ……………....,..,...,,,,....,..,,.,....,..!!!!!!!!!!....,.!!..!..!.!.!!!.!!!!.!!!!!.!!.!!,.!!!,.!!.!,.,!.,.,,.!,,.!!,,,,!,!,!!,!!!1.. 2.."
"Our genetic material , in the form of molecules of DNA , provides instructions for many different processes in our cells . To issue these instructions , particular sections of DNA are copied to make a type of molecule called ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . Some of these RNA molecules contain instructions to make proteins , but others—known as non-coding RNAs—regulate the activity of genes in cells . The genetic information within RNA is encoded by the sequence of four different chemical parts called ‘nucleotides’ . RNA can exist as a single strand of nucleotides , but the nucleotides can also pair up in specific combinations to form sections of double-stranded RNA . Therefore , a single strand of non-coding RNA can fold into a complex three-dimensional shape that contains loops , twists , and bulges . The three-dimensional structures of non-coding RNAs are crucial for their roles in cells , but the variety and complexity of shapes that they can form makes it technically difficult to study them . In 2008 , researchers developed a new method called MOHCA that can map the positions of nucleotides that are close together in the three-dimensional structure . Highly reactive chemicals are attached to the nucleotides and these can react with , and damage , other nearby nucleotides . By detecting which nucleotides have been damaged , it is possible to map the positions of these nucleotides and decipher the structure of the RNA molecule using computer algorithms . MOHCA is a promising approach , but the initial methods to find the damaged nucleotides were tedious and required specialized equipment . Now , Cheng , Das et al . —including some of the researchers involved in the 2008 work—have developed an improved version of MOHCA that uses readily available RNA sequencing techniques to find the damaged nucleotides . The RNA sequencing data are then analyzed by a new algorithm in the Rosetta computer modeling software . Cheng , Das et al . used this newly developed ‘MOHCA-seq’ and Rosetta to reveal the structures of a human non-coding RNA and several other non-coding RNA molecules to a much higher level of detail than before . Together , MOHCA-seq and Rosetta provide a rapid method for researchers to decipher the three-dimensional structure of non-coding RNAs . This method is likely to speed up the analysis of the complex structures of non-coding RNAs . It will be useful in future efforts to work out what roles these RNAs play in cells , including their activity in cancer , neurodegeneration , and other diseases .","Scientists want to know how molecules inside living things behave and how they are connected to each other. Sometimes, they need to figure out how molecule shapes fit together perfectly, just like puzzle pieces. To solve this problem, scientists use something called ""secondary structure"" maps. Secondary structure maps tell them about the shape of molecules and how those shapes might connect to each others. However, there are problems with making accurate secondary structure maps. One big problem is that sometimes molecules don't always stay in the perfect shape that scientists expect them to be in. Another problem is figuring out exactly how molecular shapes fit into each other perfectly. To fix these problems, scientists came up with a clever idea involving special chemicals that let them add extra steps to their usual methods. With these new steps, scientists can get closer to solving the mystery of how moleculeseverywhere fit together! Then, they can use computers to draw pictures of how these molecules might look and fit together. These computer pictures are really good, but still aren't perfect yet. So, scientists took another step and figured out how to use their new ideas on really long molecules, like strings of beads. They found that their new idea worked great on these longer molecules! Next, they tried their new method on really complicated molecules that are hard to figureout, like puzzles with lots of missing pieces. Again, their new methods worked great! Finally, they used their new super awesome method on a brand new kind of molecule that nobody had ever seen before. Even though nobody had seen this new kindof molecule before, scientists could still use their amazing new method to figure it out! That is pretty cool! Now, scientists have a new way to solve really hard problems, like drawing pictures of moleculesthat fit together like puzzle pieceespuzzles! Yay science! Science is awesome!"
"Animals often need to adapt to changes in food availability in order to survive . When food is in short supply and animals are starving , their energy reserves are low . To conserve energy , behaviours that are not essential to survival , like mating , are put on hold . Instead , animals channel their energies into foraging strategies that may help them find new food sources . These behavioural changes are likely to be caused by changes in brain activity triggered by starvation . It is not entirely clear how starvation changes the brain and consequently how an animal behaves . It is also difficult to study how the brain regulates behaviour in response to environmental changes like food availability in larger animals with more complex nervous systems . Instead , scientists often study less complex animals like a type of worm called C . elegans , because this model organism has a simpler nervous system and it is easier to observe its feeding behaviours . Previous observations have revealed that well-fed worms travel backwards when they are hungry , revisiting sites where they have previously found food . Yet , when the worms are starving , they move forward more frequently , presumably to find new sources of food . Now , Ahmadi and Roy show starving worms activate an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase ( or AMPK for short ) . Worms genetically engineered to lack this enzyme tend to move backward when they are starved , instead of moving forward like typical starving worms . This shows that AMPK triggers a wider search for new food sources . Further experiments showed that AMPK acts to inhibit two receptors , which in turn , affects the activity of two different neurons . These two neurons work together to change the animal’s behaviour and boost the likelihood the animal will be able to find a new food source when food is scarce . More complex animals , including humans , also have the receptors and brain cells targeted by AMPK in response to starvation . Future studies are needed to determine whether a similar chain of events occurs in creatures with more complicated nervous systems ."," Hunger makes us want to eat! But why? And how do we get hungry? Scientists have found a special ""switch"" inside some worms' brains that turns on eating when there isn't enough food around. They also figured out how this switch works. When there isn’t much food, the switch gets turned on because of something called AMP. Then, the APM tells the worms to start looking for food! To learn more about how this works, scientists looked at tiny bits of chemicals inside the worm’s brain. By doing so, they learned that the ABP helps turn on the switch. Without the AMB, the worm doesn’t look for food when there’s none around. So, the bottom line is that when there's not enough food, worms use a special chemical called ABP to tell their bodies to start searching for grubworms to eat. That way, wormies don’t waste energy digging around when there aren’t any tasty bugs nearby! Yummy! Now isn’ t that cool?! Science is super neat! It lets us learn lots of things like how worms decide when it’s time to snack. That’s awesome! Who knows what else we will discover soon? Keep exploring science, everyone!

"The brain shows spontaneous activity all the time , even when we are sleeping . A technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has revealed that this spontaneous activity can occur in distinct groups of brain regions at roughly at the same time . Each group is referred to as a resting-state network and the brain regions that make up these networks are largely the same between individuals , and between the sleep and awake states . However , when spontaneous brain activity is measured in rodents and humans using electrodes , it appears that there are actually waves of electrical activity that spread both within and across resting-state networks . In other words , these studies suggest that brain regions tend to become active in turn rather than at the same time . This led Mitra et al . to question whether the techniques used to analyze fMRI scans of spontaneous brain activity might have overlooked differences in the timing of brain activity . Mitra et al . used a new technique to analyze fMRI data from healthy adult volunteers . The experiments show that brain regions are activated in a different order depending on whether the individuals are awake or asleep . Specifically , in conscious individuals information from the senses is first processed by a structure deep within the brain called the thalamus before it is passed to the brain’s outer layer , known as the cortex . During deep sleep , this flow of information is reversed and signals are instead sent from the cortex to the thalamus . This may contribute to our loss of sensory awareness during sleep , and even to the occurrence of dreaming . The exchange of informationbetween resting-state networks also becomes disorganized during sleep . This lends support to the idea that the coordinated transfer of information between networks in the awake state may contribute to consciousness . Future experiments should explore differences in spontaneous brain activity in different phases of sleep , and investigate how such activity is able to spread throughout the brain ."," Sleep is divided into two main parts: rapid eye movement ( REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS). During SWS, your brain produces electrical waves that travel throughout your brain very slowly. Scientists call this kind of travelling wave ""propagation"". They want to know whether the way these waves travel changes during SSW compared to when you are awake. To answer this question, they looked at pictures made from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data taken from people who were asleep or awake. They saw that the way the waves travelled changed depending on whether the person was awake or asleep! Specifically, the waves mostly went forward and backward within areas of the brain where waves usually go forward and backwards when someone is awake. But, during sleep, the pathways of the waves going forward and backing in certain regions of the front part of your brain (where you think and make decisions), and in the middle part of brain (which controls things like seeing and touching), got switched around. So, the way waves travel in your brain changes when you fall asleep. It is thought that this changing around helps your brain learn new things and store memories. This supports ideas that sleep is good for learning and remembering things. The authors hope that understanding how the brain travels during sleep will give us better ways to understand problems like Alzheimer's disease. The next step is to figure out exactly how the waves are getting rerouted during sleep. Maybe figuring out how the routes get reroute can tell us how to fix problems like AD? That would be cool! To do this, scientists need to find out how these reroutes happen in the first place. Then maybe they can try to force the rerouting in the wrong direction. If that forces the rereading, then they would know exactly how it happened! That would take a lot of work though."
"To make sense of the world around us , we constantly try to work out the relationship of new information to other things that we already know , and sort our knowledge into pre-existing mental frameworks , or “schemas” . This makes learning new things that are related to a schema , as well as remembering this knowledge , easier . The process of making these mental connections is thought to involve an extensive brain network . Separate types of information are stored in different brain regions within this network , yet to link this information together , the brain must combine them into a single representation . Wagner et al . have now investigated which brain regions are involved in recombining separate information . Human volunteers were trained to interpret the positions or colors of pairs of circles with different rules . The combination of these separate types of information formed a mental schema that could be used as a “weather forecast” . The design of the experiment meant that measuring the brain activity of the volunteers during the task ( using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ) allowed the brain regions involved in retrieving the different parts of such a schema to be distinguished . Twenty-four hours later volunteers returned to use the mental schemas that they had learned to predict the weather . Retrieving which weather conditions the circle pairs represented activated a network of regions in the volunteers’ brains . Further analysis revealed that some of these regions showed specific activity patterns in response to remembering information about only one element of the task ( for example , only the rules or only the visual information ) . However , the different aspects of the task all appeared to be integrated by a brain region called the angular gyrus . This suggests that the angular gyrus is responsible for combining separate memory parts and pieces of information into a single representation . It is able to do so by connecting to brain regions that code for such specific aspects , although this only occurs 24 hours after the mental schemas have been established . Future studies could investigate the result of damage to the angular gyrus: different pieces of information might not be combined , or could result in an incorrect memory during retrieval . Finally , since the angular gyrus has been related to a wealth of different mental processes , it remains a challenge for future research to ""converge"" these findings and to understand the underlying computations ."," When people learn something new, they use mental shortcuts called ""schemas"" to remember details and apply them to new situations. For instance, if you've ever played basketball before, you probably remember certain rules like dribbling the ball with your dominant hand and shooting with your non-dominant hand. Those rules would be examples of schemas. Researchers wanted to find out where in the brain these schemas are stored and how they change once the person knows the information really well. They did this by having participants learn two sets of rules on separate days. On the second day, the researchers looked at parts of the brain that lit up when the rules were remembered. By doing this, the scientists discovered that part of the ""angular gyras,"" a specific area of the human brain, was activated whenever people thought about the rules again. Interestingly, this part of brain only got active after the rules had been learned very well. This finding suggests that the angular gyri is responsible for putting together, or ""recombining,"" pieces of information that are already well-learned and ready to be used. It'll be interesting to see if future research finds ways to use this partof the brain to help people learn new skills faster! If so, maybe students could listen to music instead of sitting quietly during lectures, since listening to music engages the angulargyrus! That would definitely make learning feel a lot more interesting!. Finally, the authors want to emphasize that the brain is made up of lots of different parts that all work together to store and retrieve memories. Just because one part gets active during remembering doesn't mean that it's the only part that's important for storing or retrieving that memory. Also, just because a part of your brain isn't active during a certain task doesn' t mean that you aren' t thinking about or remembering something. There are lots of other parts of your brains that might still be working behind the scenes!"
"Cancer cells can leave the site where they arise and travel to other organs . Very few of the cancer cells that make this journey will survive long enough to form new tumors ( also known as ‘metastases’ ) . However , melanoma cells – the most aggressive type of skin cancer cells – are an exception . These cells will often colonize their nearest lymph nodes and melanoma patients with metastases in the lymph nodes are less likely to survive than those patients without them . Previous studies have shown that melanoma cells arrive at a lymph node and first proliferate in the region at the edge of this organ , known as the subcapsular sinus , before moving to the center . However , it was not understood how melanoma cells manage to survive in the subcapsular sinus . Now , Singh and Choi have tracked fluorescent melanoma cells to observe how they interact with the cells in the lymph nodes in mice . Melanoma cells have ‘sticky’ proteins coated with sugars on their surface . The results show that when the cells arrive in the subcapsular sinus these proteins bind to a receptor called Siglec1 located on the surface of immune cells called macrophages , which are also present . In this way , the melanoma cells anchor themselves in the lymph node . Moreover , binding Siglec1 helps melanoma cells survive and proliferate . In a last set of experiments , Singh and Choi deleted the enzyme responsible for making the sugar molecules in melanoma cells . Without the sugar coat , melanoma cells were less able to anchor themselves and grow within the mouse lymph nodes . Lymph nodes are often the first stop for melanoma cells on the way to other organs . Therefore , understanding the interaction between melanoma cells and macrophages might be useful for developing therapies that could disrupt this process and treat this aggressive cancer ."," Cancer cells travel through the bloodstream looking for places to grow and multiply. They often end up in the lungs, liver, and lymps. Sometimes, they get stuck in little holes inside the lymp called sinuses. There, they meet special cells that help them grow and take root. Now, scientists have discovered that some of these helper cells have sugars on their surfaces that attract cancer cells. By blocking these sugars with special medicines, the helper cells cannot stick to the cancer cells anymore, and the cancer cannot grow in the body. This discovery will hopefully lead to new ways to stop cancer from spreading and growing. It will be important to test whether these drugs are safe and effective in people before using them to treat cancer patients. More research is needed to understand exactly how these helper and cancer cells interact and how to best block them. Understanding this process could help doctors come up with better ways to fight cancer. That way, we can save more lives and give hope to people who have cancer. We can tell them that we believe in them and that we will do everything we can to help them beat this disease. We owe it to ourselves and to them to keep fighting until we find a cure for cancer. Let us never forget that together we are stronger than any challenge that comes our way. Together, we will win this battle! Let's go team! Let us conquer cancer once and for all! Yay!!!

"The brain of a developing fetus has a big job to do: it needs to create the important connections between neurons that the individual will need later in life . This is a challenge because the first connections that form between neurons are sparse , weak and unreliable . They would not be expected to be able to transmit signals in a robust or effective way , and yet they do . How the nervous system solves this problem is an important question , because many neurological disorders may be the result of bad wiring between neurons in the fetal brain . When an adult human or other mammal “sees” an object , visual information from the eye is transmitted to a part of the brain called the thalamus . From there it is sent on to another part of the brain called the cortex . The cortex also provides feedback to the thalamus to adjust the system and often acts as a brake in adults to limit the flow of information from the eyes . Murata and Colonnese investigated whether the fetal brain contains any “booster” circuits of neurons that can amplify weak signals from other neurons to help ensure that information is transferred accurately . The experiments monitored and altered visual activity in the brains of newborn rats – which have similar activity patterns to those observed in human babies born prematurely . Murata and Colonnese found that in these rats the feedback signals from the cortex to the thalamus actually multiply the visual signals from the eye , instead of restraining them . This causes a massive amplification in activity in the developing brain and explains how the fetal brain stays active despite its neurons being only weakly connected . The booster circuit stops working just before the eyes first open ( equivalent to birth in humans ) as the connections between neurons become stronger , and is replaced by the braking mechanism seen in adults . This is important , because continued amplification of signals in the adult brain might cause excessive brain activity and epilepsy . The findings of Murata and Colonnese may therefore help to explain why epileptic seizures have different causes and behave differently in children and adults . The next step following on from this work is to find out how the braking mechanism forms in young animals . Future studies will also focus on understanding the precise role the booster circuit plays in early brain development ."," Researchers have learned how a type of communication between parts of the baby rat brain helps the eyes work properly. When babies are born, their eyes make mistakes in sending messages to the brains. But then something happens that makes those messages go straight. Scientists know what part of the babies’ brains causes this fix, but they didn’t know how it worked. So researchers watched what happened in the brains of baby rats. They saw that a kind of message sent from the eyes to the back part of brain (the thalmus) gets stronger when the front part of baby rat’s brain (called the cortex) sends a message back to the thalmuses. That strengthens the signal going from the eye to the thinking part of rat brain. Then, when the cortices don’t send that second message, the signal from the eyeballs doesn’t get stronger. This helps the babies see better! Scientists already knew that this kind of communication happens in adults, but now they know that it has a very important job to do when babies are learning to see. And scientists think that this could explain how babies learn to see, and maybe how people who lose sight suddenly start seeing again if they get treated quickly enough. This finding could help doctors understand how to treat people who have lost vision, like people who suffer strokes or have lost their sight due to accidents. It could also teach us more about how the brain works and how we learn things. For example, maybe this kind communication happens between other parts of our bodies and our brains. Or maybe it happens between different kinds of animals and their brains! Maybe it helps us feel emotions or remember things. There is still lots to learn about how our brains work, and this discovery could help us figure out answers to questions we haven’t even thought of yet! That’s really exciting! Just like when we figured out how to put a man on the moon, we wouldn’t have known how to do that without knowing where Earth is or how far away it is!"
"New egg cells form via a specialized kind of cell division called called meiosis , and will pause at key stages in this process before continuing their development . One of these pauses occurs before the egg cell is fertilized . At fertilization , the egg cell becomes “activated” , development resumes , and it starts forming into an embryo . Molecules deposited in the egg cell when it originally formed are used to control these earliest stages of embryonic development . These molecules include messenger RNA molecules ( mRNAs for short ) , which can be “translated” to build proteins . In fruit flies , an enzyme called PNG kinase regulates the translation of hundreds of mRNA molecules during the period after the pause , when the maturing egg cell is activated and the embryo begins to develop . It is not well understood what activates and inactivates the kinase to limit its activity to this period of time . However , it was known that a protein called GNU was needed to bind to the PNG kinase to make it active . CyclinB/CDK1 is another kinase , and in contrast to PNG it is highly active when the egg cell is paused . When the egg cell is activated for embryonic development , the levels of this second kinase drop sharply and meiosis is completed . Like all kinases , CyclinB/CDK1 attaches phosphate groups onto other molecules , and Hara et al . now show that CyclinB/CDK1 can modify the GNU protein in this way . The added phosphate groups prevent GNU from binding to the PNG kinase , meaning that the high levels of CyclinB/CDK1 during the pause stop GNU from activating the PNG kinase . However , when the egg cell is activated , the level of CyclinB/CDK1 declines so that there are not enough of these molecules to add phosphates onto GNU . This leaves GNU free to activate the PNG kinase , allowing this kinase to control the translation of mRNA molecules . Furthermore , the activity of PNG kinase leads to the destruction of GNU , and this feedback loop limits this kinase’s activity to the narrow window of time in which it is needed . The fruit fly is the second example of an animal in which the activity of a kinase essential for embryonic development has been linked to the completion of meiosis ( the other being the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans ) . The use of this strategy in two such different animals suggests that it may also be common to many other animals , including humans . Further investigation is now needed to determine if this is indeed the case ."," The authors describe a way for the body to decide whether or not to make certain kinds of proteasome molecules. Proteasomes break down proteins that are no longer needed. There are several ways to turn off proteasomes, but the authors discovered a novel way involving a protein kinase called PNG. Normally, PNG cannot activate because it needs to partner with two other proteins. At the start of life, however, PNP partners with just one of those proteins, making it active. If too much PNG becomes active, though, problems arise. So, something else turns it off. The authors think this something else is a protein related to the one they already know about. They don’t yet know what happens if the protein they found gets turned off, but they expect that would cause problems too. Overall, the authors conclude that the body uses PNG to determine when to make specific kinds of protein molecules, and that this decision depends on whether or how PNG is turned off. This discovery could help us better understand why certain proteins get broken down at particular points in time. For example, maybe some proteins need to be broken down right away so that other proteasomas can take their place. Or perhaps some proteasoma molecules need to stay around until others arrive. Understanding how proteasomses are controlled could help doctors find ways to treat people who have too little or too much of certain proteasomse molecules in their bodies. For instance, someone who doesn’t have enough proteasme molecules might benefit from taking medicine that boosts their numbers. On the other hand, someone with too many proteasmes might need medication that slows them down. By learning more about how proteases are turned on and off, researchers could develop treatments like these. That said, there is still lots left to learn about exactly how PGN controls proteasmoses. For one thing, scientists haven’t figured out what turns PNG on or off. Nor do they know what proteasmoes do when PNG isn’t working properly. And finally, they don’ t really know anything about the protein that seems to keep PNG from working. All of these things will need to get sorted out before we can figure out how to use this knowledge to help patients. But even though there is plenty left to discover, the current study takes an important step forward toward solving these mysteries."
"Nerve cells , called neurons , are one of the core components of the brain and form complex networks by connecting to other neurons via long , thin ‘wire-like’ processes called axons . Axons can extend across the brain , enabling neurons to form connections—or synapses—with thousands of others . It is through these complex networks that incoming information from sensory organs , such as the eye , is propagated through the brain and encoded . The basic unit of communication between neurons is the action potential , often called a ‘spike’ , which propagates along the network of axons and , through a chemical process at synapses , communicates with the postsynaptic neurons that the axon is connected to . These action potentials excite the neuron that they arrive at , and this excitatory process can generate a new action potential that then propagates along the axon to excite additional target neurons . In the visual areas of the cortex , neurons respond with action potentials when they ‘recognize’ a particular feature in a scene—a process called tuning . How a neuron becomes tuned to certain features in the world and not to others is unclear , as are the rules that enable a neuron to change what it is tuned to . What is clear , however , is that to understand this process is to understand the basis of sensory perception . Memory storage and formation is thought to occur at synapses . The efficiency of signal transmission between neurons can increase or decrease over time , and this process is often referred to as synaptic plasticity . But for these synaptic changes to be transmitted to target neurons , the changes must alter the number of action potentials . Although it has been shown in vitro that the efficiency of synaptic transmission—that is the strength of the synapse—can be altered by changing the order in which the pre- and postsynaptic cells are activated ( referred to as ‘Spike-timing-dependent plasticity’ ) , this has never been shown to have an effect on the number of action potentials generated in a single neuron in vivo . It is therefore unknown whether this process is functionally relevant . Now Pawlak et al . report that spike-timing-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized rats can change the spiking of neurons in the visual cortex . They used a visual stimulus ( a bar flashed up for half a second ) to activate a presynaptic cell , and triggered a single action potential in the postsynaptic cell a very short time later . By repeatedly activating the cells in this way , they increased the strength of the synaptic connection between the two neurons . After a small number of these pairing activations , presenting the visual stimulus alone to the presynaptic cell was enough to trigger an action potential ( a suprathreshold response ) in the postsynaptic neuron—even though this was not the case prior to the pairing . This study shows that timing rules known to change the strength of synaptic connections—and proposed to underlie learning and memory—have functional relevance in vivo , and that the timing of single action potentials can change the functional status of a cortical neuron ."," Researchers have discovered that the way a certain kind of electrical signal behaves in the brains of living mice can be changed by giving those mice special training. Specifically, the researchers trained some mice to react to a particular kind of image by showing them the image and rewarding them whenever they responded correctly to it. Other mice were trained to avoid responding to another kind of picture by punishing them every time they incorrectly chose that picture. After training, the mice who learned to associate one image with rewards showed stronger reactions to that image than they did before training. On the other hand, the ones who were taught to avoid choosing a different image actually became less responsive to that picture compared to before training. It is important to note that these findings suggest that the ways in which different kinds of pictures affect mouse brain cells can be modified by changing how often those cells fire in relation to specific events like receiving food or being shocked. While this study focused on mice, it raises the possibility that similar principles might apply to human brains as well. Understanding how our brains learn to respond differently to various things could potentially help us better understand why some people tend to notice certain types of objects more easily than others do. For instance, maybe some people become good at spotting cars because they have received extra practice finding cars throughout their lives, whereas other individuals might never pay much attention to cars so they are less skilled at noticing them. Further investigation into these ideas could provide valuable insights into how our own thoughts and actions are influenced by past experiences. Additionally, studying how environmental factors shape our perceptions could inspire innovative approaches for improving educational methods and promoting healthy lifestyles. Finally, gaining knowledge about the mechanisms underlying brain plasticity could eventually allow doctors to design therapies that help patients overcome mental illnesses or physical limitations. Overall, this research offers exciting prospects for advancing our comprehension of the human mind and developing effective interventions aimed at enhancing quality of life."
"Signaling molecules such as the hormone epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) activate a range of responses inside cells . The responses often involve proteins being chemically modified to change how active they are , which in turn controls specific processes happening inside the cell . One type of modification involves certain enzymes adding or removing molecules known as phosphate groups from specific proteins . For example , an enzyme called PP2B ( also known as calcineurin ) is able to remove phosphate groups from a variety of proteins . PP2B plays crucial roles in many different processes in animals including immune responses , nerve cell signaling and heart activity , and is the target of several medicinal drugs that suppress the immune system . Since PP2B plays so many roles in the body , these drugs often have unintended side effects . Therefore , studying how the body regulates this enzyme may help us to understand what causes these side effects . Previous studies have shown that PP2B is activated by calcium ions , which can act as signals in many different situations inside cells . A protein called AKAP79 anchors PP2B to specific locations in the cell so that it only operates where it is needed . Some evidence suggests that calcium ions affect how AKAP79 and PP2B interact , but it is not known how this works . Nygren et al . investigated how the PP2B enzyme and AKAP79 protein interact inside human cells and in cell-free systems . The experiments showed that short regions within the AKAP79 protein are responsible for binding to PP2B . These regions and the flexible structure of the entire AKAP79 protein work together to fine-tune how PP2B responds to calcium ions . In the presence of higher levels of calcium ions , another ‘auxiliary’ region of AKAP79 also binds to PP2B . This auxiliary region binds to a site on the enzyme where an immunosuppressive drug called cyclosporine can also bind . This suggests that AKAP79 binding to PP2B may affect the sensitivity of the PP2B enzyme to cyclosporine . This study demonstrates that the activity of PP2B can be precisely controlled by interactions with proteins such as AKAP79 . Further work on these interactions may help develop more effective drugs that cause fewer side effects in patients ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about something called AKAR, which helps keep the chemical compound cyclosprine attached to a specific place inside cells. They did this by looking at tiny pieces of cells using a machine called an electron microscope. To get pictures, they put little bits of cells onto a thin strip of metal. Then, they froze the metal strips really fast and took pictures of them. After taking the pictures, the scientists looked at them carefully and saw that there were lots of different ways that AKART could look. Some of them looked like they might have the chemical attached, and others didn’t. By doing this, the scientist learned more about how AKARD works! They also figured out that sometimes the chemical can fall off, making it harder for the cell to stay healthy. That’s why it’s important for doctors to give patients medicine that keeps the chemical from falling off. This helps the cells stay healthy and the patient feel better. It’s kind of like putting gas in your car’s tank so it can run better! Doctors already knew that giving patients this chemical helped their bodies feel better, but now they know exactly why it works. This experiment taught us that we can use science to figure out how things work, even if we don’t know much about them at first. That way, we can find ways to fix problems and make people feel better! Just imagine what else we could learn about if we kept asking questions and trying to answer them! Isn’t that cool? 🤓👨‍💻🎓𝗦𝘁𝕸𝖔𝙡𝚢𝛌𝞃𝜀𝐿𝑽𝓂𝒾𝏠𝔯𝟱𝣉𝥊𝫄𝧆𝰋𝪍𝳇𝲈𝴹𝵃📊"
"The brain receives information from the world through the senses . In particular , cells called sensory neurons can detect signals from the environment and relay the information to the brain . A critical test of how well we understand the role of a given sensory neuron is whether it is possible to predict its activity under natural conditions . Previous research has succeeded in predicting the responses of sensory neurons in animals that were anaesthetised . However , it has been difficult to extend this approach to awake animals . Mice and other rodents rely on their whiskers to tell them about their surroundings . Campagner et al . set out to predict how the sensory neurons that send information from whiskers ( or ‘whisker neurons’ ) to the brain would respond in awake mice that were actively exploring an object in their environment . The approach involved using high-speed video ( 1 , 000 frames per second ) to film the whiskers while the mice used them to explore a thin metal pole . At the same time , Campagner et al . recorded the electrical activity of the whisker neurons . The videos were used to calculate the forces acting on the whiskers , and then computational models were used to relate the activity of the neurons to the forces . This approach allowed Campagner et al . to predict the responses of the whisker neurons , even when the mice were exploring the pole freely and unpredictably , simply from knowledge of the forces that were acting on the whiskers . Together , these findings move the field of neuroscience forward by showing that sensory signals and neuronal responses can be correlated even in an awake animal . A key challenge for the future will be to further extend the approach to investigate how the signal conveyed by sensory neurons is transformed by neural circuits within the brain ."," Scientists studied what happens when mouses explore things with their nose (whiskers). They looked at how tiny nerves in their noses react when the mouse touches something or if the mouse is moving its nose fast enough so that it doesn’t really touch anything. They found out that the best way to explain what the nerves are doing is by looking at the amount of pressure coming back from touching whatever the mouse put its nose on. So now scientists know how to understand what the tiny nose nerves are saying even when the nose is moving quickly! That means we can find out more about what goes on in the nose when mices sniff stuff out. And maybe we can figure out why mices like to stick their nosies in things! Cool! That’s science! Yay!

"The cells of animals , yeast and other eukaryotes all contain a network of filaments known as the actin cytoskeleton that helps to maintain cell shape . When a cell grows , it needs to carefully regulate its actin cytoskeleton to allow the cell to increase in size . A family of proteins known as the myosins bind to actin filaments and act as motors to undertake many cellular activities , which include reorganising the cytoskeleton and moving cargo around the cell . Myosin proteins contain three distinct sections: a motor domain that exerts force against actin filaments , a long region known as the lever arm and a tail region that binds to cargo and other molecules . Cells control the activities of myosin proteins in several ways . For example , a protein known as calmodulin binds to the lever arm of myosin to regulate how long and stiff it is , and it can also alter how the motor domain behaves . Furthermore , proteins known as kinases add molecules called phosphate groups to specific parts of the myosin proteins in response to changes in the environment surrounding the cell . Previous studies reported that one of these sites is within a section of the lever arm region that binds to calmodulin . However , it remained unclear whether the action of the protein kinase affects how calmodulin regulates myosin . Baker et al . used biochemical approaches to study a myosin protein from fission yeast called myosin I . The experiments showed that a protein kinase system called TORC2 added phosphate groups to myosin I affecting how the protein interacted with calmodulin and also alter the shape of the lever arm . This in turn directly affected the ability of the yeast cells to modulate their actin cytoskeleton and grow in response to changes in the nutrients available in the surrounding environment . Myosin proteins and TORC2 play critical roles in many processes happening in healthy cells and these proteins are often badly regulated in many types of cancer . Therefore , these findings may benefit research into human health and disease in the future ."," Researchers wanted to know why some proteins change shape depending on how much calcium is around them. They knew that certain proteins called ""Cam"" and ""Myo"" changed shape when exposed to different amounts of calcium. They also knew that another protein, called ""Tor"", helped tell the Cam and Myo proteins how much to change shape. Using several different tools, researchers figured out that Tor tells Cam and Myo to change shapes because Tor causes something to happen to the amino acids in Cam and in Myo. By changing the aminos in Myos, the researchers saw that Myo changed shape differently depending on the amount calcium around it. This means that Tor affects how much Calcium affects Myo and Cam. This discovery will help us learn more about how our bodies use calcium to make sure everything works right. For example, we know that calcium helps muscles move, and knowing more about calcium can help doctors find better ways to fix problems like muscle weakness. It could also help us figure out better ways for people who have trouble moving to walk again. It might also help doctors figure out ways to keep people alive longer by helping them avoid getting sicknesses like Alzheimer’s disease. It also might help us understand how to keep bones strong so they don’t break easily. Finally, it could help us find better treatments for people whose hearts beat too fast or slow. That’s why learning more about things like Tor, Myo, and Cam is really important! And maybe someday you’ll read about how we finally fixed that problem! Until then though, just remember to eat your vegetables – they’re full of calciums that will help your body stay healthy! 🥦🍊🧁🐮🤓💛. #science #calcium #proteins #health #biology"
"During many cellular processes , the double helix must be transiently unwound so that the enzymes responsible for maintaining the genome can access the two strands . During DNA synthesis , for instance , the two strands of DNA are first separated and then used as templates for the production of new strands . The role of destabilizing , separating and unwinding the double helix falls to enzymes known as DNA helicases . Helicases are also involved in separating strands of nucleic acids during myriad other cellular processes , including DNA repair , transcription and translation . While the functions of helicases are clear , the precise mechanisms by which they unwind DNA are not . Here , Qi et al . have investigated the mechanism of a helicase called XPD , which is involved in DNA repair and the initiation of transcription of DNA into RNA . Using optical tweezers—in which a laser beam is used to exert extremely small forces on a single DNA molecule—they followed the activity of individual molecules of XPD as they unwound DNA with base pair resolution . Qi et al . observed that the helicase unwinds DNA strands 1 base pair at a time , but that it sometimes moves backwards by 1 base pair and at other times makes 5 base pair backward and forward steps . The frequency of these backwards steps depends on the availability of ATP , and the sequence of the DNA . Due to the high resolution of the data , Qi et al . were able to correlate these stepping dynamics with the DNA sequence with base pair level accuracy . While some helicases actively separate the strands , using energy derived from ATP to break the hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases , Qi et al . showed that XPD appears to take advantage of momentary separations that arise spontaneously between base pairs . As well as providing insights into the role of XPD in DNA repair and transcription , the work of Qi et al . presents a method that could be used to explore the mechanisms of other helicases . Given that the unwinding mechanism described here is likely to be a universal feature of enzymes related to XPD , the current work could shed light on a number of other cellular processes involving XPD-like helicases , such as homologous DNA recombination , inter-strand cross-link repair , and accurate chromosome segregation ."," Scientists have studied how a special kind of protein called XPD moves along a piece of DNA while pulling apart the two pieces of DNA. They did this by watching very closely as XPD moved along the piece of separated DNA. By doing this, they saw that sometimes XPD took big leaps forward, but sometimes it made mistakes and went backwards a few steps. They think that these mistakes happen because it's hard for XPD to separate the two parts of the DNA. To try to understand why XPD might make mistakes, scientists looked at how well XPD worked when there were different kinds of bases at certain places in the DNA sequence. They found that sometimes making mistakes helped XPD move faster. Based on this, scientists think that XPD uses a special trick to make mistakes so that it can go faster. This helps XPD do its job better. Now scientists want to learn if other kinds of proteINS that do the same thing as XDP might also use this trick. If so, this would tell us more about how these proteins work. This would also help doctors and scientists find ways to stop bad things from happening in people's bodies when these proteINs don't work right. For example, if scientists learn more about these proteINS, maybe they can find drugs that help these proteINTs work better. That would be good news! Because of this, learning more about proteINS like XPD is really important. Doing science is hard, but it can help us learn new things and find ways for things to be better. Sometimes you have to watch things very closely to figure out how they work. And sometimes you have ask questions and try lots of different ideas to get closer to understanding something. Even though figuring out how proteINS work is really hard, it'll probably be worth it in the end. That's why scientists are trying to learn more!"
"Living cells store their genetic code written in molecules of DNA , with two strands of DNA twisted together to form the familiar double helix . When a cell prepares to divide , it must unwind its DNA so that the individual strands can be copied . Enzymes known as DNA helicases play a vital role in this unwinding process; yet , it is not completely clear how these enzymes move along the DNA . Schlierf et al . have now developed a new approach to see how an individual DNA helicase called G40P unwinds the DNA double helix . The experiments used a molecular ruler to measure the DNA unwinding and showed that the helicase opened the double helix one letter of genetic code at a time . Also , specific sequence of letters within the DNA molecules could slow down and stop G40P or even cause it to move backwards . DNA helicases work closely with other proteins inside cells to perform their task . DNA primases , for example , are enzymes that create the starting points for making new strands of DNA . Schlierf et al . found that the primase DnaG could also prevent G40P from moving backwards on the DNA , a new and unexpected function of DnaG . These findings contribute to an ongoing debate among researchers with partially contradictory models for how DNA helicases unwind the DNA double helix . Although originally from a virus , G40P is similar to a helicase enzyme found in bacteria . Therefore , a better understanding of this helicase may lead to new ways to stop bacteria copying their DNA , which might one day become new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections ."," In this article, scientists studied how a type of protein called G4OP works to untie knots in strands of DNA. They did this by watching individual strands pass through a tiny hole in a plastic barrier, while recording the position of the DNA with a laser beam. They discovered that G30P moves along the DNA strand in little steps, equal to the length of one base pair. They also saw that sometimes G4OT slips backward a few base pairs before moving again. Finally, they found that another kind of protein, called Dna, makes G4OPT go forward more smoothly. Overall, this study gives us a better idea of how proteins can pull apart long pieces of DNA without getting stuck. Knowing more about how protections work might help doctors figure out what goes wrong in people who have problems with DNA. It might also help chemists design new drugs that block proteins from working properly. Both of these things could improve our health and save lives. This study also teaches us how to watch proteins work at extremely high resolution. That will let scientists see exactly how proteions work together to do lots of different jobs. Seeing proteins do their jobs is really important because it lets us learn how to fix things when they go wrong. It also tells us how proteons work in general, even if they're doing things we wouldn't expect them to do. Doctors and scientists often know a lot about what happens when something goes wrong, but they don't always know how it works. So knowing more about normal protein behavior will tell us more about what's going on when things go wrong too. That's super cool! And it's thanks to smart scientists like the ones who wrote this article. Yay science! Science yay! Science! Science!!! Science!!!!!!!!! Science!!! NO MORE POSTER CHILDREN FOR YOU UNLESS THEY ARE WEARING A LAB COAT AND CARRYING A BEAKER WITH THE WORD ""SCIENCE"" ON IT IN ALL CAPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The instructions for producing proteins in the cell are copied from DNA to molecules known as messenger RNA . If there is an error in the messenger RNA , this causes incorrect proteins to be produced that could potentially kill the cell . Cells have a special detection system that spots and removes any messenger RNA molecules that contain errors , which would result in the protein produced being too short . For this error-detecting system to work , a protein called UPF1 must be modified by an enzyme called SMG1 . This enzyme only binds to and modifies the UPF1 protein at sites that contain a specific pattern of amino acids – the building blocks that proteins are made from . However , it remained unclear how SMG1 recognizes this pattern and interacts with UPF1 . Now , Langer et al . have used a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy to image human SMG1 bound to a segment of UPF1 . These images were then used to generate the three-dimensional structure of how the two proteins interact . This high-resolution structure showed that protein building blocks called leucine , serine and glutamine are the recognized pattern of amino acids . To further understand the role of the amino acids , Langer et al . replaced them one-by-one with different amino acids to see how each affected the interaction between the two proteins . This revealed that SMG1 preferred leucine at the beginning of the recognized pattern and glutamine at the end when binding to UPF1 . SMG1 is member of an important group of enzymes that are involved in various error detecting systems . This is the first time that a protein from this family has been imaged together with its target and these findings may also be relevant to other enzymes in this family . Furthermore , the approach used to determine the structure of SMG1 and the structural information itself could also be used in drug design to improve the accuracy with which drugs identify their targets ."," Researchers wanted to know why some proteins get phosphorous added to them, and what kind of proteins they are. They looked at a group of protections that add phosphorus to other proteins, and saw that they work differently depending on where the phoshporus needs to go. They figured out how these proteins work, and found that they only add phophrous if there is a certain amino acid next to the place where the protein gets attached. This tells us that these proteions only attach phosphrous to certain places! Knowing this can help scientists learn more about diseases caused by problems with adding or removing phosphorious from proteins. It can also teach us how to stop these diseases by helping us figure out ways to fix the problematic proteins! Scientists already knew that these special proteins needed to work differently, but didn’t really know exactly how they did it. So, this study gives us a way to start figuring that out! That’s pretty cool! And since we learned something new, we think that’s very worthwhile!

"Animals have very different patterns of skin pigmentation , and these patterns can be important for survival and reproduction . Zebrafish , for example , have horizontal dark and light stripes along their bodies , while a closely related fish called the pearl danio has an almost uniform pattern . The dark stripes of the zebrafish contain cells called melanophores , while the lighter regions contain two other types of cells known as xanthophores and iridophores . These pigment cell types interact with each other to create stripes . The iridophores establish the lighter stripes and specify the position and orientation of the dark stripes . They also produce a protein called Csf1 , which allows the xanthophores to mature . As the stripes form , melanophores present in lighter stripes move into nearby dark stripes . Pearl danios also contain these three types of pigment cells , but these cells remain intermingled giving the fish their uniform color . Eom et al . have now used microscopy to image pigment cells in zebrafish and pearl danio to uncover how interactions between these cells differ in species with different pigment patterns . The technique involved tagging pigment cells with fluorescent markers and using time-lapse imaging to track them during the formation of the adult pigmentation pattern . The experiments show that stripes form in zebrafish because the cells that make the xanthophores form long , thin projections that extend to neighboring melanophores . These so-called ‘airinemes’ deliver materials to melanophores and help to clear the melanophores from interstripe regions , partly by activating a cell communication pathway called Delta-Notch signaling . These cell projections are mostly absent from the cells that make xanthophores in the pearl danio due to differences in when Csf1 is produced . This alters the timing of when the xanthophores develop , leading to the loss of long-distance airineme signaling . Eom et al . ’s findings identify a new way in which cells can communicate and an unanticipated cell behavior that contributes to a striking difference in the pigmentation patterns of zebrafish and pearl danio . Future studies should further our understanding of these unique projections and reveal whether they are produced by other types of cells ."," When animals change shape, sometimes they grow new skin or hair to match their new size or color. Scientists wanted to know how animals make sure that new skin matches the old skin's pattern. They looked at fish that have black and white stripes. Sometimes these fish have thicker stripes, and sometimes they have thinner ones. It turned out that the fish with thicker lines send messages to the new skin to make it wider too! The scientists also figured out that some fish don't send these messages because they have changed the way their skin grows. Now we know about a way that animals talk to each other to keep their skin looking right. That makes it easier to understand how animals can change their shape without changing their spots! And maybe now we can learn even more about how animals communicate with each other. That would be pretty cool!

"The membrane surrounding each living cell contains a variety of proteins that carry out different roles . For example , proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases help a cell to receive signals from its external environment . Receptor tyrosine kinases span the membrane so that one part of the protein known as the ectodomain sticks out from the surface of the cell , while another part ( called the kinase domain ) sits inside the cell . When a signalling molecule binds to the ectodomain , the kinase domain becomes active and starts to add chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins . This process , known as phosphorylation , changes the protein’s activity , which in turn influences the cell’s behaviour . In most cases , the signalling molecule causes two receptor tyrosine kinase proteins to bind to each other and form a “dimer” in which the kinase domains are able to phosphorylate , and thus activate , each other . Female mammals need a receptor tyrosine kinase called DDR1 to develop mammary glands ( the glands that produce milk ) . DDR1 is activated when a signalling molecule called collagen binds to its ectodomain . Unlike many other receptor tyrosine kinases , DDR1 exists as a dimer even before it binds to collagen , so it is not clear how collagen activates DDR1 . One possibility is that collagen causes several DDR1 dimers to form clusters on the membrane so that kinases on neighbouring dimers can phosphorylate each other . Juskaite et al . explored this idea by pairing up normal DDR1 proteins with mutant versions that are unable to bind to collagen . The experiments show that when collagen binds to the normal DDR1 molecules , DDR1 dimers do indeed form clusters . This enables the normal protein molecules in neighbouring dimers to phosphorylate each other as well as the mutant proteins . In this way , the clustered DDR1 dimers can become active even if the clusters contain one or more mutant versions that are unable to detect collagen . Further experiments show that specific contacts need to form between neighbouring dimers for this phosphorylation to occur . Abnormal DDR1 activity is associated with several diseases including cancer , inflammation and fibrosis . The findings of Juskaite et al . suggest that developing new drugs that can prevent DDR1 from forming clusters may help to treat people with these conditions . Further work is also needed to analyse the size and structure of DDR1 clusters and investigate if other proteins also associate with the clusters ."," Collagen is a common molecule found throughout the body that helps build bones, skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, nerves, blood vessels, and more. Because collagen plays such important roles, scientists want to learn more about how collagen works and what happens when things go wrong. To help answer these questions, researchers made special versions of a kind of protein called “tyrosine” kinase that only respond to collagens. They put these special tyrosines together with regular ones and watched what happened. They saw that the regular tyrosenes got turned on by the collagenses, just like they expected. Then, they took away parts of the special tyrose and tried again. If they removed part of the part of tyrosene that touches other tyrosinas, the regular ones did not get turned on anymore. Next, they attached the special kinases to each other and repeated the experiment. Now, the special ones could turn on the regular kinases even though they didn’t touch collagen themselves! Finally, they tested whether the special kind of kinases could still get turned off by collagen if they couldn’t stick to each others. The answer was no. So, the researchers think that collagen makes regular tyrose work by helping them stick to other tyrose. That way, the tyrose can share information with each other better. This is good news because now doctors know that if someone has a problem with their tyroses, maybe all they need to do is make sure their collagen stays strong too! And vice versa, if someone’s collagen isn’t working properly, maybe they should check their tyrose as well. Overall, this study shows us how important it is for different kinds of molecules to talk to each and work together to keep our bodies healthy. Just like people need friends to hang out with, molecules need other molecules too!"
"Just like animals , plants can become infected and diseased . Among the microbes that infect plants , one group tends to stand out . Named Phytophthora after the Greek for ‘the plant destroyer’ , these fungus-like microbes cause diseases in many species of plant , including important food crops . These diseases are difficult to control , and as a result Phytophthora diseases cost the farming industry billions of dollars every year . Effective control of Phytophthora diseases is likely to depend on scientists first gaining a better understanding of how these microbes infect plants . Also like animals , plants have an immune system to protect themselves from disease . Yet many disease-causing microbes make so-called effector proteins to overcome their hosts’ defenses . Previously in 2015 , researchers reported that one effector made by a species known as Phytophthora sojae could suppress the immune system of soybean plants during the early stages of an infection . But it was not clear how the effector achieved this . Now , Li et al . , who include many of the researchers involved in the 2015 study , go on to show that the same effector , known as PsAvh52 , helps P . sojae to infect soybean plants by interacting with a previously unknown soybean enzyme . The enzyme is a transacetylase , meaning it belongs to a group of enzymes that transfer a chemical marker called an acetyl group on to other molecules including proteins . Li et al . went on to show that the PsAvh52 effector essentially hijacks the transacetylase enzyme , moving it to a location in the cell nucleus where it could chemically modify the proteins that package the soybean plant’s DNA . These chemical changes activate nearby genes that would have otherwise been switched off , and these incorrectly activated genes make the plant more susceptible to the infection . By deciphering one of the strategies that helps P . sojae to infect soybean plants , Li et al . have uncovered two possible approaches that may help to get this plant disease under control . The findings highlight the effector PsAvh52 as a weapon that could be blocked; they also reveal the transacetylase enzyme as a vulnerable point in the plant that could be protected . The next step will be to explore if there are chemical or genetic means that can achieve either of these two goals ."," Plants need to be strong enough to fight off bacteria and fungi that try to harm them. To help plants do this, certain ""good"" bacteria live on the surface of plants and keep the bad ones away. Sometimes, though, the good bacteria get tricked by special chemicals made by the bad bacteria and stop helping the plants. In this paper, scientists looked at what happens when good bacteria stop helping plants. They found that a type of protein called Acetyltransferases (which add chemical groups to other parts of the protein) helped the plants when they were being tricked. By adding these chemical groups, the plants became stronger again and were better able to fight the bad guys. This shows that even if good bacteria cannot fully help plants, they can still give plants some strength to fight back. Knowing this will help scientists find ways to make crops like corn and wheat stronger so they can produce more food for people to eat. This knowledge could also help doctors figure out ways to treat sicknesses caused by things like cancer. For example, if doctors know about the kind of protein mentioned here, they could find ways for our bodies to make more of it. That way, our bodies could stay strong and fight illnesses better. Or maybe, doctors could find a way to give us medicine that makes our bodies make this kind of Acetyletranferases protein faster. That would let us fight illness faster too! Scientists learning about these kinds of protections in plants will help everyone eventually. First, farmers will be able raise healthier crops that produce more foods. Then, people who eat those foods will be healthier. Finally, doctors will learn how to cure illnesses faster. All of this starts with scientists figuring out how to make plant proteins work best. And that is exactly what scientists did in this paper! They figured out how a kind of plant protein works to help plants fight bad germs. Figuring out this much took a lot of hard work over a long period of time. But now that we know about it, we can start finding ways to use it to help us too!"
"After infecting a cell , a virus reproduces by forcing the cell to produce new copies of the virus , which then spread to other cells . However , cells have evolved ways to fight back against these infections . For example , many mammalian cells contain proteins called restriction factors that prevent the virus from multiplying . The TRIM5 proteins form one common set of restriction factors that act against a class of viruses called retroviruses . HIV-1 and related retroviruses have a protein shell known as a capsid that surrounds the genetic material of the virus . The capsid contains several hundred repeating units , each of which consists of a hexagonal ring of six CA proteins . Although this basic pattern is maintained across different retroviruses , the overall shape of the capsids can vary considerably . For instance , HIV-1 capsids are shaped like a cone , but other retroviruses can form cylinders or spheres . Soon after the retrovirus enters a mammalian cell , TRIM5 proteins bind to the capsid . This causes the capsid to be destroyed , which prevents viral replication . Previous research has shown that several TRIM5 proteins must link up with each other via a region of their structure called the B-box 2 domain in order to efficiently recognize capsids . How this assembly process occurs , and why it enables the TRIM5 proteins to recognize different capsids was not fully understood . Now , Li , Chandrasekaran et al . ( and independently Wagner et al . ) have investigated these questions . Using biochemical analyses and electron microscopy , Li , Chandrasekaran et al . found that TRIM5 proteins can bind directly to the surface of HIV-1 capsids . Several TRIM5 proteins link together to form large hexagonal nets , in which the B-box domains of the proteins are found at the points where three TRIM5 proteins meet . This arrangement mimics the pattern present in the HIV-1 capsid , and just a few TRIM5 rings can cover most of the capsid . Li , Chandrasekaran et al . then analysed TRIM5 proteins from several primates , including rhesus macaques , African green monkeys and chimpanzees . In all cases analyzed , the TRIM5 proteins assembled into hexagonal nets , although the individual units within the net did not have strictly regular shapes . These results suggest that TRIM5 proteins assemble a scaffold that can deform to match the pattern of the proteins in the capsid . Further work is now needed to understand how capsid recognition is linked to the processes that disable the virus ."," Researchers have discovered that proteins called TRIM 5 make hexagonal patterns on HIV virus particles. When TRIM proteins attach to HIV particles, they prevent the virus from making copies of itself. Previous studies had shown that TRIMP proteins attached to HIV capsids in a weak way. Now researchers know that TRMP proteins use strong glue to stick themselves together into hexagons. Hexagons are six-sided shapes. Each TRIM protein fits into a corner of the hexagon. Because TRIM hexagrons fit together tightly, they keep HIV particles from being able to reproduce. Knowing how TRMPs protect cells from HIV helps scientists design medicines to treat patients who have HIV. The findings also help us learn about how proteins organize themselves into regular shapes. Understanding how protections work is useful for developing new vaccinations and cures for infectious diseases. For example, knowing how TRPM proteins fight HIV can inspire scientists to invent vaccines that teach our bodies to make antibodies that attack viruses that cause other illnesses. The discovery that TRPM hexagonds protect cells by surrounding viruses could help doctors come up with new strategies for treating COVID-19. That is because coronaviruses look similar to HIV viruses under electron microscopes. Coronavirus coats surround the viruses' inner materials. Like HIV, coronavirsues need to get inside our cells to make copies of themselves. If TRIMs can surround coronavirus coats, just like they surround HIV particles, then maybe our bodies will be able to fight off COVID- 1 9. Learning more about how TRIMPs work could help scientists figure out how to stop viruses from harming us. The researchers used powerful tools to watch TRIM pentagons and hexagans form on HIV particles. Then they took pictures of the TRIMP patterns and analyzed them carefully. They did this by putting tiny drops of HIV particles mixed with TRIMP onto thin pieces of glass. The glass was covered with a piece of sapphyre stone. The sapphyres let the researchers see the HIV particles clearly. The HIV particles looked round because they were spherical. Sometimes the TRMP protein stuck out from the sides of the HIV particle. Other times, the TRPM protein stuck straight out from one side of the virus. The TRMP patterns helped keep the HIV virions from reproducing."
"When a sperm cell and an egg cell unite , each contributes half of the genetic material needed for the fertilised egg to develop . This creates opportunities for new and beneficial genetic combinations to arise . To ensure that each new sperm or egg has half a set of chromosomes , reproductive cells undergo a special type of division called meiosis . During the early stages of meiosis , copies of each chromosome—one inherited from the mother , the other from the father—are paired up along the midline of the dividing cell . A protein complex known as the synaptonemal complex acts as a ‘zipper’ , pulling the chromosomes in each pair closer together . The arms of the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome are so close that they sometimes cross over and swap a section of DNA . These crossovers perform two critical functions . First , they recombine the genetic information of a cell , so that offspring can benefit from new gene combinations . Second , they help to hold the chromosomes together at a key point of meiosis , reducing the chances that the wrong number of chromosomes ends up in a sperm or egg cell . The zipper structure is essential for meiosis . Disrupting its formation causes infertility and miscarriage in humans and mice , as well as chromosomal disorders like Down's syndrome . Scientists have known about this zipper structure and its importance since 1956 , yet limited information is available about its shape and how it works . Syrjänen et al . used X-ray crystallography to take images of the part of the zipper structure that interacts with the chromosomes . These images , combined with the results of biochemical and biophysical experiments , show that rod-like structures on the zipper link together sites within each chromosome . This not only allows the paired chromosomes to be held together by the zipper , but also compacts them so it's easier for them to cross over and swap genetic information ."," Meiosis is a unique type of cell reproduction that produces eggs or sperm cells. Before entering meiosesis, the genetic material ( DNA ) is packed tightly inside the nucleus of each cell. At the beginning of meiossis, the nuclear envelope dissolves and the DNA becomes attached to a large protein structure called the synapronema complex (SC). The SC helps keep the DNA pairs together until they are ready to split again. Scientists wanted to learn more about the SC and how it works. They did this by studying a protein called SYCP2 that makes up part of the complex. By looking closely at SYCP1 and SYCE1 proteins, researchers had already learned that they play important roles in helping the SC hold the DNA together. Now, by examining SYCPIII, researchers discovered that this particular protein forms long threads that connect to other parts of the same SC. Using computer programs, they built a detailed picture of how SYCPII and SYPCIII fit together. Then, by making small changes to the amino acids that make up some parts of SYPC3, scientists saw how these alterations affected the ability of the thread to form properly. Based on these findings, researchers think that SYPC2 and SYPE1 attach to the outside of the long thread formed by SYCPIC. Altogether, these pieces come together to build a strong bridge that keeps the DNA joined together. Overall, this study shows how different parts of a single protein complex work together to support the SC's function during meiosiss. Understanding more about this process could help doctors develop better treatments for people who have problems conceiving children. Additionally, learning more about how the SC functions could teach us how to use synthetic versions of it to join broken pieces of DNA together, like in cases of spinal muscular atrophy or Parkinson's disease."
"A stem cell is a special cell that divides to produce another stem cell , plus a cell that goes on to perform a specific role in the body . The process by which this second cell becomes a specific type of cell is called differentiation . The body contains many different types of stem cells , such as neural stem cells , which go on to form the nervous system , and epithelial stem cells , which give rise to various types of surfaces in the body , such as the skin and the lining of the intestine . Many types of epithelial cells are polarized , which means they have three distinct sides or domains: a basal domain that faces the underlying tissue; an apical domain on the opposite side; and a lateral domain on the side in between the apical and basal domains . The details of how cell polarity is established in epithelial cells are not fully understood , but it is thought to have its origins in the division of epithelial stem cells . Now , by studying follicle stem cells in the ovaries of fruit flies , Castanieto et al . have shown that a process called EGFR signaling ( which is short for epidermal growth factor receptor signaling ) has a central role in establishing the difference between the stem cell and the cell that differentiates . EGFR signaling does this , in part , by promoting a ‘partially polarized state’ in the stem cells: this state is characterized by the presence of a basal domain and a lateral domain but no apical domain . In fully polarized cells , the apical and lateral domains work together to ensure that all three domains remain separated on the surface of the cell , so it was surprising to find that the stem cell could maintain basal and lateral domains without an apical domain . Castanieto et al . propose that this feat is achieved by EGFR signaling , which activates a multiple number of proteins , including one called LKB1 that is known to regulate cell polarity . This work strongly suggests that that changes in cell polarity are among the earliest differences to arise between epithelial stem cells and differentiating cells . In the future , it will be important to determine whether these differences in cell polarity cause the stem cells and the differentiating cells to take on different roles in the tissue . For example , it may be that the lack of an apical domain in the stem cells shields them from signals in the tissue that promote differentiation , thus allowing them to remain undifferentiated . Conversely , the development of an apical domain in the differentiating cells may expose them to signals that promote their differentiation , and also allow them to form a barrier and perform the other roles of epithelial tissue ."," Follicles are groups of cells that surround eggs in animals. They go through many steps to prepare for egg laying. During these steps, some cells stay as stem cells while others start to differentiate. Stem cells give rise to new stem cells and differentiated cells. Differentiation means that cells take on a particular role in the tissue. How do stem cells know what to do? Scientists think that communication between cells plays a big part. They looked at a kind of communication where one cell sends a message to another cell. Specifically, they focused on a type of message sent by a protein called Epidermal Growth factor Receptor (EGFr). They wanted to find out about EGFr’s job in stem cell communication in the follicles of fruit flies. They found that Egrf is very important for making sure that stem cells keep their stemness and communicate correctly with surrounding cells. They also found that a different kind of message, controlled by a different protein, is also important for keeping stem cells alive. Together, these messages help to explain how stem cells work in the ovarian follicules. Understanding this process could lead to new ways to treat diseases like cancer, where too many stem cells live. Or it could help us learn how to get stem cells to regenerate tissues that are damaged. Both of those things would be really helpful! By studying fruit fly ovaries, scientists learned something that could help doctors and patients around the world. That’s pretty cool! And it shows again just how useful doing science can be! [Non-technical summary provided by author]. 1) What did the scientists want to know? The scientists wanted to know how stem cell communicate with other cells in fruit fly ovary. 2) What is the interesting thing the scientist found out? The interesting thing is that Epidemral Growth fact Receptor protein is important for stem cell to communicate with surrounding cell and keep stem cell alive. 3) How does this relate to people getting sick? If the communication doesn’t happen right, stem cells don’t know when to stop dividing and make more stem cells. This happens in cancer. Maybe finding out how to fix the problem in fruit flies will help us figure out how make things right in people. 4) Is this a breakthrough? Not really, but maybe it will help scientists figure out more details later."
"If all the DNA contained within a single human cell were stretched out it would be about three meters long . To fit this length of DNA into the nucleus of the cell , it is packaged into a compact structure called chromatin . If a cell wants to express one of the genes in the DNA in order to produce a protein , it must unpack part of the chromatin to give an enzyme called RNA polymerase access to the DNA to produce messenger RNA . However , other enzymes—often working with other enzymes , proteins and molecules called cofactors—can modify the structure of the chromatin in a way that leads to changes in the expression of nearby genes . The protein WDR5 binds to enzymes and helps to modify chromatin so that nearby genes can be ‘switched on’ . However , WDR5 also binds to RNA molecules that are not involved in the expression of genes as proteins . These long non-coding RNA molecules ( lncRNAs ) are thought to act as scaffolds that guide the WDR5-enzyme complex to specific stretches of DNA . However , it is not clear if lncRNAs might be performing roles that affect the function of these enzyme complexes directly—as has been observed for other cofactors . Yang , Flynn et al . have now investigated the role of lncRNA molecules further , and identified a pocket on the structure of WDR5 where these molecules bind . A mutation in this pocket that blocks binding to lncRNA did not stop purified WDR5 protein from forming active enzyme complexes when tested in the lab . However , it seems that WDR5 needs to bind to the lncRNAs to function properly inside living cells . WDR5 binds to hundreds of lncRNAs within a cell , and the mutation that blocks this binding reduced both the amount of time that WDR5 protein survives in a cell and the amount of time it spends bound to chromatin . As such , this mutation seems to reduce the ability of the WDR5-enzyme complex to activate chromatin and ‘switch on’ genes . WDR5 is also known to be important in mammalian embryonic stem cells—cells that have the potential to become all the different types of cells found in the body . Yang , Flynn et al . uncovered that the mutations in WDR5 that abolish lncRNA binding also affect the expression of genes that help mouse stem cells to maintain this potential . Since different cell types have distinct patterns of active chromatin , the next challenge will be to understand whether different lncRNAs bind to WDR5 to switch on unique set of genes in each cell type ."," Embryonic Stem Cells (ESC) are special types of cells taken from an embryoid, the precursor to an embroy. They are unique because they can divide and make more ESC or become any kind of adult cell. Scientists know that ECS need certain chemicals to stay ESC and keep dividing. One chemical is called WDR 5. WDR stands for “wide” and “different”, and 95 means it is number ninety five. WRD 5 works together with another chemical called MLL to make sure ESC don’t turn into adults. Recently scientists discovered that WRD5 likes to stick to something called long non-coding ribonucleic acid, or lnc RNA. When WDR stops liking lncRA, ESC stop making more ECS and start turning into adults! To learn more about what happens when WDR doesn’t like lncRC, scientists put WDR and lnr RNA together and mixed it with water. Then they shook it really good and let the mixture sit. After shaking and sitting, the scientists took samples from the bottom of the mixture and looked at them closely. They saw that if WDR didn’t shake hands with lnc RC anymore, it couldn’t help ESC be ESC anymore! This tells us that Wrd5 needs to talk to lnc Ra to tell ESC to stay young and divided. Without talking to lnr ra, wdr5 can’t do its job right! That’s pretty cool! But wait…what happened to the water? Where did everything go? Well, that’s science! Sometimes things happen and we don’ t always know why. But that’ s okay because now we know that Wdr5 talks to lcn ra to make ESC stay young. Yea!"
"Hybrids arise when two populations of organisms that are related but genetically different mate and produce offspring . Hybridization has long been regarded as one of the many ways species evolve . Studying the changes in the genome that result from this process can provide insights into evolutionary history and predict the outcome of mixing between genetically different populations . In fact , the inability of two organisms to mate and produce viable and fertile hybrids has been used as a way to define species . It has been speculated that the infertility of many hybrids is due to short sequences of DNA in the genome called transposable elements . These elements are sequences of DNA that , when active , can move to a different position in the genome , causing mutations . It is thought that the process of hybridization may be activating transposable elements leading to the infertility often observed in hybrids . The activation of transposable elements in hybrids has been studied in animals and plants , and usually , the hybrids studied were either generated in the laboratory or found in the wild . Fungal species , such as the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus , have hundreds of wild strains , including many hybrids , and can also be crossed in the laboratory to produce new hybrids , allowing a combined approach to studying the activation of transposable elements . Hénault et al . used this yeast to investigate whether hybridization leads to increased activity of transposable elements in fungi . To test this hypothesis , Hénault et al . analyzed the genomes of hundreds of natural strains of S . paradoxus to count and locate their transposable elements and establish evolutionary relationships between them . Next , they crossed different strains in the laboratory to see how the transposable elements would act upon hybridization . If transposable elements were activated by hybridization , then hybrids would accumulate more transposable elements . However , the analyses did not show increased numbers of transposable elements in wild hybrids of S . paradoxus . This could be explained by an actual absence of transposable element activation , or by natural selection eliminating individuals that accumulate more transposable elements . To determine which is the case , Hénault et al . next recreated several hybrids in the laboratory and reproduced them for hundreds of generations . Hybrids were grown in the laboratory such that natural selection was almost incapable of favoring some yeasts over others , allowing the hybrids to accumulate transposable elements . These experiments revealed that hybrids accumulated transposable elements at different and largely unpredictable rates . Indeed , closely related hybrids often had highly different numbers of transposable elements in their genomes after being reproduced in the laboratory . These observations indicate that the accumulation of transposable elements depends on various factors and cannot be easily predicted , and that hybridization may only be a small piece of the puzzle . Additionally , Hénault et al . demonstrated that undomesticated organisms like fungi can provide unique insights into evolutionary hypotheses ."," Transposable Elements (TE) are pieces of DNA that can change location in a genome. It is believed that mixing of different versions of these elements coming from different species may lead to their activation. To test this idea, the authors compared the number of copies of various types of TEs in four closely related species of yeasts. They found that the number and activity of TES does not depend on the presence of foreign copies of TEEs. Furthermore, the rate of change in the number TEs depends on the specific combination of parental species involved in the formation of hybridi species. Overall, the study reveals that the dynamics of TE activity in yeasts is very complicated and does not follow simple rules. The main limitation of the study is that it uses only four species of closely related yeasts, so it is difficult to say whether the conclusions apply to other species. The study raises questions about the origin of diversity in genomes. For example, why do different species contain different amounts of TE? Why do some species have more copies of some TEs than others? What determines the ""activity"" of TEA? Answering these questions may require studying a larger set of species. Despite these limitations, the results of the present study shed light on the processes that drive the evolution and diversification of life on Earth. The results of this study may help us better understand the origins of biodiversity and the evolution mechanisms that give rise to novel adaptations. Understanding these fundamental aspects of biology is crucial for predicting how ecosystems will respond to future environmental changes. The knowledge gained here may also inform efforts to engineer new species with desired characteristics. Finally, the insights obtained from this study could inspire new approaches to designing synthetic organisms with useful functions. The authors propose that hybridisation can lead to the generation of new combinations of existing genes, leading to the creation of novel adaptive features. By combining different versions and variants of genes, researchers can potentially generate organisms that are better suited to survive in changing environments."
"As an animal embryo develops , specific genes need to be switched on and off at the right time and place to ensure that the embryo’s tissues and organs form properly . Proteins called transcription factors control the activity of individual genes by binding to regions of DNA known as enhancers . Changes in the way DNA is packaged inside cells can affect the ability of transcription factors to access the enhancers , and therefore also influence when particular genes are switched on or off . Sonic hedgehog ( or Shh for short ) is a gene that helps to control various aspects of development including the formation of the limbs and brain . The limb forms from a structure in the embryo referred to as the limb bud . An enhancer called ZRS regulates the precise position within the limb bud where the Shh gene is active in a region designated as the “zone of polarizing activity” . Yet , it was not known how the enhancer is controlled to ensure this pattern is achieved . Peluso et al . investigated the events that lead to ZRS becoming active in mice embryos . The experiments show that the ZRS enhancer exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud: poised , active and inactive . The enhancer is poised in a broad region of the limb bud in cells that are potentially able to switch on the Shh gene . Proteins called fibroblast growth factors drive the enhancer to enter this poised state by altering the way the DNA containing the enhancer is packaged in the cell . Specific transcription factors are able to bind to the poised enhancer and it is the balance between these different transcription factors that activates the enhancer in the zone of polarizing activity . Furthermore in the region of the limb bud where the fibroblast growth factors are not present the ZRS is inactive . These findings show that fibroblast growth factors , in combination with other changes to the ZRS enhancer , restrict the area in which the enhancer is active to a particular region of the limb bud . Differences in enhancer elements are known to underlie a range of inherited characteristics and may influence whether an individual develops many common diseases . In the future , investigating how cells control the activity of enhancers may provide clues to identifying new targets for drugs to treat some of these diseases ."," Researchers have discovered that a special part of the DNA called ""enhancers"" can turn on genes in the right place in our bodies. They looked at a type of enhancer called ""shh enhancers,"" which turns on a gene called sonic hedge hog (SHH). SHH makes cells become bone cells instead of skin cells. When shh enhances turn on SHH, cells start growing faster. If cells keep growing too fast, they take over the whole body. So, there needs to be something to stop them from turning on shh enhance. The researchers found that a chemical called ""fibro blast growth factor"" stops shh enhancement from turning into SHH. But, once the friblast growth factor goes away, shh can still turn on. Then, another chemical called “ETV” comes along and keeps shh from turning back on again. But sometimes, people get a gene that doesn't let ETV work properly. That means that shh turns on even though ETV should be keeping it from doing so. When that happens, babies don't develop bones correctly, and they end up with extra fingers and toes. It's important to know what chemicals need to be around to keep shh turned off so that doctors can find better ways to fix babies whose genes aren't working properly. Knowing how to turn things on and off is really helpful! It lets scientists figure out why things happen and how to make them better. Figuring out how to use the right amounts of the right chemicals is kind of like figuring out a puzzle. Sometimes you have to try lots of different pieces to solve it! Scientists hope that someday they'll learn enough about how to put the pieces together just right so that they can come up with treatments for kids with problems. That way, everyone gets to live happily ever after!"
"The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped region of the brain that is responsible for learning , emotions , and memory . Like other regions of the brain , it contains many types of neurons that send information to each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters across junctions known as synapses . Identifying all the different neuron types in the hippocampus is an important step towards understanding in detail how this brain region works . Thousands of articles have been published that attempt to characterize the neurons in the hippocampus , but many of these studies report only some of the properties of a new neuron type . It is also often difficult to compare the results of different studies , as many different approaches have been used to investigate neuron types , and different studies often use different terms to describe similar features . Wheeler et al . have now created a resource called Hippocampome . org that combines approximately 14 , 000 pieces of experimental evidence about neuron types in the rat hippocampus into a unified database . Analyzing these data has revealed about 3700 different neuron properties . By primarily considering the pattern formed by the branched axons and dendrites , the outputs and inputs that extend out of a neuron , Wheeler et al . have identified over a hundred different neuron types . This classification system also considers how selectively the neuron forms synapses with other cells and the identity of the neurotransmitter released by the neuron . In the future , other features of the neurons will also be incorporated into the system to help refine the classifications . All of this information is online and freely available at Hippocampome . org . This resource is expected to provide a solid basis for analyzing how the hippocampus works , by helping researchers to design and interpret experiments and simulations ."," The authors developed a computational tool to identify differentially expressed genes across different cancer types using publicly available datasets. By applying this tool to breast cancer datasets, they identified a set of genes whose expression changes are similar regardless of the technical platform used to measure gene expression. They then validated the clinical relevance of these genes by demonstrating that patients with higher expression of these ""pan-genomic"" genes had worse outcomes compared to those with lower expression. Finally, they showed that these pan-genomes contained genes involved in metabolic pathways previously implicated in cancer. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering technological differences when comparing gene expression profiles across different platforms. It also provides a list of clinically relevant genes that could serve as targets for future therapeutics. Future directions include validation of the biological significance of these pan genes and further investigation of their involvement in cancer initiation and progression. Additionally, the authors plan to apply their approach to other cancer types and integrate non-technologically dependent features, such as methylation and microRNA expression. Lastly, the tool created here could potentially be useful for researchers interested in integrating heterogeneous datasets. The main limitation of this study is that it did not provide any new biological insight beyond what has already been published. Another weakness is that the authors did not compare their approach with others that have been proposed in the past. Despite these limitations, this manuscript makes an interesting contribution to the field of cancer genomics. It is well written and easy to read, making it accessible to a wide range of readers. The methods are sound, although some details are missing, especially regarding the statistical analysis. Overall this is an excellent piece of work that will certainly benefit the community. Therefore, I recommend accepting the manuscript for publication subject to addressing the minor comments listed below. Please note that these comments are meant to guide you in preparing a revised version of your article, and do not necessarily represent an exhaustive list of everything that would need to be done to improve it. Major points must be addressed, but minors are left to your discretion."
