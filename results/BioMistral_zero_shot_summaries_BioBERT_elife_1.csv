"Imagine a gymnastics competition in which participants take turns to cartwheel and somersault across the floor . The routines on display comprise sequences of precisely timed movements learned through practice . This is also true for many of the actions we perform every day , such as reaching for a cup of coffee . A region of the brain called the cerebellum helps us learn sequences of movements . But how does it do this ? To find out , Khilkevich et al . came up with a new version of an old experiment . Rabbits were first trained to blink their eye in response to a specific external cue . This type of learning , called associative learning , has been shown before in the cerebellum . But Khilkevich et al . wondered whether the cerebellum could also use internal feedback signals from the eyeblink as a cue to learn the next movement ? If so , this might explain how the cerebellum can chain movements together in a sequence . As predicted , Khilkevich et al . found that rabbits could learn to blink their eye in response to an initial signal , and then blink again in response to the first blink . Control experiments confirmed that the second eyeblink was coupled to the first , and not to the original cue . Moreover , on many trials the rabbits showed a third and even fourth eyeblink . This is because feedback signals from the first , second or third blink were the same . Thus , the feedback signals from the first blink triggered the second blink , feedback from the second triggered the third , and so forth . Rabbits could also learn to use a blink of the left eye as a cue for a blink of the right eye . Similar patterns of neuronal activity accompanied each blink , suggesting that the same mechanism generated them all . The cerebellum can thus use feedback from one movement as a cue to learn the proper timing of the next movement in a sequence . A key question is whether this mechanism of sequence learning extends beyond movement . The cerebellum has extensive connections to the brain’s outer layer , the cortex , including many areas involved in cognition . Future experiments should test whether the cerebellum might help guide sequences of cortical activity during cognitive tasks ."," This study looked at how the brain controls complex actions made up of multiple parts or steps. It used an animal model called eyelid reflex conditioning, which allows researchers to train animals to respond to specific events. For example, they could be trained to close their eyes when they hear a sound. Researchers found that the part of the brain responsible for coordinating these types of activities, called the cerebral bell, uses similar methods to coordinate different parts of the action. They also showed that it does not matter what order the parts happen in because the cerebella will still know what to do. Overall, this shows us that the cerebra bell coordinates complex actions using very basic building blocks. This helps scientists understand more about how we move our bodies and why some people have trouble moving due to problems with their cerebela. It may even help doctors find new ways to treat people who have issues like this. However, it should be noted that while this study was done carefully, there might be other factors involved that were not considered here. Therefore, further studies are needed before drawing any conclusions. Further research on this topic would help us better understand how our brains work and potentially lead to new treatments for neurological disorders. Additionally, it highlights the importance of studying individual components of complex behaviors and how they interact with each other."
"To grow and multiply , a living cell must take a variety of factors into account , such as its own energy levels and the availability of nutrients . A protein called mTOR sits at the core of a signaling pathway that integrates these and other sources information . Problems with the mTOR pathway contribute to several diseases including diabetes and cancer . The mTOR protein occurs in two distinct protein complexes , called mTORC1 and mTORC2 . These complexes contain a mix of other proteins – known as accessory proteins . They also sense different cues and act upon distinct targets in the cell . Recent research reported the structure of mTORC1 , which provided clues about how this complex works . Yet , much less was known about the mTORC2 complex . Stuttfeld , Aylett et al . have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the three-dimensional architecture of the human version of mTORC2 . Comparing the new mTORC2 structure to the existing one for mTORC1 showed that they have many features in common but important differences too . The overall shape of both complexes is similar and each complex contains two copies of mTOR arranged in a similar way . Also , the main accessory proteins in each complex interact with almost the exact same parts of mTOR , but the accessory proteins in mTORC2 are organized differently from those of mTORC1 . The different accessory proteins also have distinct shapes . These differences could help to explain why the complexes respond to different cues and recognize different targets . These new findings provide an entry point for further studies on how mTORC2 works in cells . The next step is to get a higher resolution image of the structure of this complex to see the finer details of all the components . This may in the future help scientists to develop drugs that inhibit mTORC2 to treat cancer and other diseases ."," Scientists have discovered that there are two different groups of molecules called mTORS1 and 2. These molecules work together to control how our bodies use energy from food to grow and survive. When these molecules don't work properly, it can lead to problems like diabetes or cancer. Some medicines can stop one group of these molecule from working, but they don' t always work well. In this study, scientists used special tools to look closely at the structure of one group, mTORT2. They found out that some parts of this group were made up differently than other parts. This could explain why certain drugs only affect one part of these groups. By knowing more about how these groups work, doctors might be able to find better ways to treat diseases caused by these moleculs not working right. However, more studies need to be done before we know if these new findings will help people get better treatment. (306 words) Lay Summary (Simplified): Scientists want to make better medicine for people who have diabetes, cancer or other illnesses. One way to do this is by learning more about the things inside our body that cause these illnesses to happen. There are some things inside us called ""mTOR"" that we know can cause these problems. Sometimes, doctors give patients medicine that stops these mTors from doing their jobs. But sometimes these medicines don’t work very well. That’s because there are actually two groups of these mTOrs inside us. Each group does its own job, and each group has its own medicine that can stop them from doing those jobs. So, when someone takes medicine, it usually just stops one group from working. If you take a medicine that only stops one of the groups, then the other group still keeps working! Now, scientists have learned even more about one of these two groups, which is called mTOrc2. The scientists looked really close at this group using special tools. They figured out that one part was put together differently than another part. Because of this, doctors now know more about what makes these groups tick. With this knowledge, maybe doctors can figure out new ways to make medicine that works on both groups so that none of them keep causing trouble."
"Our sense of number is thought to have emerged from the circuits of cortical neurons in the brain that originally represent space , a process known as 'cortical recycling' . Accordingly , our perception of space and number are tightly intertwined: for example , people think about numbers on a mental number line , where smaller numbers are mapped to the left , and larger numbers are mapped to the right . Also , damage to a brain region called the parietal cortex disrupts both space and number processing . If number processing recycles the neurons that encode space , which form does this appropriation take ? Recycling could preserve the original behavior of the neurons ( processing space ) , thus enriching the neurons’ functional repertoire with a new capacity ( processing number ) . Alternatively , the newly developed role could replace the original one , such that space and number cohabitate the same brain area but use separate neurons . To disentangle these hypotheses , Schwiedrzik et al . used a technique called 'perceptual adaptation' . Here , continuously showing someone a particular feature eventually exhausts the neurons that respond to that feature . Neurons that respond to the opposite feature are however less exhausted and dominate perception . Consequently , people perceive the opposite of what they are adapted to . For example , after continuously seeing dots moving to the right , people perceive stationary dots as moving to the left . Similarly , after being exposed to large numbers of dots they underestimate how many dots they see . If the same neurons process numbers and space , then adapting to movement in a particular direction should influence number perception . During Schwiedrzik et al . ’s experiments , volunteers watched moving dots on a computer screen . After seeing dots move to the right , they underestimated the number of dots that then appeared on the screen . This is likely to be because larger numbers are mentally mapped to the right , and seeing rightward motion for a long time exhausted these neurons . This means that neurons that respond to smaller numbers ( mentally mapped to the left ) were more active when the new dots were presented , leading the volunteers to underestimate how many dots they saw . Adapting to leftward motion led to the opposite effect , with volunteers overestimating the number of dots . Thus , motion can literally move us up and down the number line . These results indicate that the same neurons encode both space and numbers . Cortical recycling does not erase the neurons’ original behavior: instead , neurons may carry out the same computations when processing numbers or space . This would allow the brain to add new functionality without sacrificing any of the computational resources for processing space ."," In our study, we found evidence suggesting that the same part of the brain (located in the back of the skull) helps us process how big an object is as well as how fast it moves. This finding supports the idea that different abilities can use similar parts of the brains, even though they were thought to be separate before. Specifically, when looking at moving dots on screen, participants perceived more dots than there actually were if those dots moved from left to right compared to right to left. When asked about the opposite situation, participants saw fewer dots when the dots first went from right to lateral compared to left to later. These effects occurred because of how people perceive objects' size and speed based on where they think these things are located. Our findings suggest that the brain uses the same areas to help us understand how far away something is and how quickly it moves, regardless of whether we are thinking about its location or numerical value. This means that the way we see one thing affects how we see another thing, even if they seem very different at first glance. By understanding how the brain processes multiple types of information together, researchers might better understand what happens when someone struggles to learn math concepts or has trouble reading maps. For example, maybe some people have difficulty using certain parts of their brain to process both spatial and numerical information simultaneously. If so, then training exercises could target these specific regions to improve performance in other skills that rely on the same parts of our brains."
"When an embryo is developing , stem cells must divide and develop into many specialized types of cells . However , if cell division doesn't stop , or if it restarts later in life , it can cause tumors to form . Musashi-1 is a protein that binds to molecules of RNA and helps to promote cell growth during development: mice that lack this protein have serious brain defects and die shortly after birth . Musashi-1 is usually turned off in adult cells that are not dividing . Sometimes , however , it remains active and contributes to the growth of cancers in the brain and the gut . Reducing Musashi-1 levels in colon tumors slows their growth and causes the cancer cells to die . To find a compound that would switch off Musashi-1 , Clingman et al . screened more than 30 , 000 compounds and identified four inhibitors . One of these was oleic acid , a fatty acid that is found in olive oil and other animal and plant oils . Oleic acid interacts with Musashi-1 in a way that changes the shape of the protein . These changes mean that Musashi-1 is no longer able to regulate the genes that control cell proliferation . Clingman et al . also found that Musashi-1 promotes the activity of a particular enzyme that makes fatty acids; molecules that are needed in large quantities when cells are dividing . Musashi-1 appears to act as a ‘nutrient sensor’ , turning down the activity of this enzyme in cells when levels of oleic acid are high , and turning up enzyme activity when oleic acid levels are low . The findings of Clingman et al . further reveal how our diets can affect gene expression , and may aid the development of new treatments against cancer ."," This study found that a type of molecule called fatty alcohol can affect how another type of protein called Musashi works. Normally, Musashi helps make certain kinds of cells grow properly during development. However, when there's too much fatty-acid alcohol around, it stops working correctly. This happens because the presence of these molecules causes Musashi to no longer be able to stick to certain parts of the body where it needs to work. By understanding more about how Musashi does its job, scientists might be able find ways to help cells develop better or treat diseases related to abnormal cell growth. For example, they might be better able to understand why some people get cancer or how to stop tumors from growing once they already exist. They also might learn new ways to use Musashi or similar proteins to control how cells behave in the lab. That would let them make things like medicines or vaccinations based on what they learned. Overall, this study shows that Musashi is important for helping cells do their jobs right, but that sometimes too many fatty molecules can mess up how well those cells work. It also suggests that there may be other types of molecules out there that can tell if cells are making enough energy or food to survive, which could give us clues about how to keep our own bodies healthy."
"Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . The arrival of an electrical signal called an action potential at the first neuron triggers the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse . These chemicals then diffuse across the gap between the neurons and bind to receptors on the second cell . The neurotransmitter molecules are stored in the first cell in packages known as vesicles , which release their contents by fusing with the cell membrane . Following a fusion event , neurons must replenish their vesicle stocks to ensure that they are ready for the arrival of the next action potential . This replenishment process is known to involve a calcium-dependent pathway and a calcium-independent pathway . A protein called calmodulin , that binds calcium ions , has an important role in the first of these pathways . Now , Liu et al . have shown that another protein , synaptotagmin 7 , also has a key role in the replenishment of synaptic vesicles , possibly as a sensor for calcium ions . Moreover , Liu et al . found that synaptotagmin 7 and calmodulin bind to each other to form a complex , which suggests that the calcium-dependent replenishment pathway is regulated by this complex . The synaptotagmins are a family of 17 proteins , three of which are present in all animals . Two of these were known to have roles in synapses , but the role of the third—synaptotagmin 7—had been unclear . In addition to providing a more complete understanding of the replenishment of synaptic vesicles , the work of Liu et al . also supplies the final piece of the jigsaw regarding the role of the synaptotagmins that are present in all animals ."," This study focused on understanding how synapses work at the molecular level. Synapse is a specialized junction between two cells where communication takes place through electrical or chemical signals. Chemical signaling involves releasing small packets called vesicles from one cell into the space between cells so that they can be received by another cell. These vesicular packets contain chemicals known as neurotransmitters which act like messengers. After transmission of signal, the vesicals need to be refilled again before next round of transmission. In order to understand the mechanism behind this process, researchers studied a protein named synaptotgamin-7 (syt-7) using genetic techniques. They made mutant versions of this protein and observed their effects on the process of refilling the vesciles. Their results showed that sut-7 plays an important role in refilling of vesices after transmission of chemical signal. Further experiments revealed that spt-7 interacts with other molecule called calmoduline (CaM). Overall, this study suggests that syp-7 along with CaM play an essential role in filling up the vascicles after transmission. It will help us better understand the mechanisms underlying normal functioning of brain and may lead to new therapeutic targets for treating neurological disorders."
"People may experience a stressful or traumatic event that can cause anxiety in their day-to-day lives . For some people , this anxiety can persist and develop into a disorder , such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or acute stress disorder . Millions of people worldwide suffer from these disorders , but there are few classes of drug treatments currently available . Some preliminary studies in mice have suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs called cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors may relieve symptoms of anxiety . COX-2 inhibitors target an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 , which is produced in many tissues throughout the body and brain . Some COX-2 inhibitors , such as Celebrex , are already widely used to treat arthritis . Studies in people have also suggested these drugs given in combination with antidepressants might also help people with depression , while a recently developed COX-2 inhibitor , called LM-4131 , stops the breakdown of chemicals produced in the brain that interact with the same brain receptors that marijuana does . In animal studies , this new drug reduced anxious behaviors . However , scientists didn’t know if the drug would also reduce anxious behaviors after animals were exposed to a traumatic or stressful experience . Now , Gamble-George et al . – including some of the same scientists that created LM-4131 – show this drug does reduce anxious behavior in mice after a traumatic or stressful experience . In the experiments , mice were stressed with an electric shock to their feet and then treated with LM-4131 , Celebrex , another COX-2 inhibitor sometimes used in humans , or an inactive control . The mice were then placed in new environments or mazes high off the ground that usually trigger anxious behavior . The mice treated with any of the three COX-2 inhibitors were less likely to act like they were anxious than the mice treated with the control solution . Gamble-George et al . then showed that LM-4131 changes how cells in the brain become excited in both isolated mouse brain cells and live mice . Short-term stress in humans is known to excite cells in an area of the brain called the amygdala , which controls how we respond to stress or trauma . The experiments showed that LM-4131 decreases this activity and decreases anxiety in stressed mice . Future animal and human studies are needed to confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a useful treatment for stress disorders , and learn more about how they work ."," This study looked at how certain drugs can help treat mood and anxiety problems caused by stress. These drugs work on something called ""cyclooxyganse 2"" which helps regulate chemicals in our brains. They tested different types of drugs that target this ""cyclooxygenase 2"", and found that they all helped reduce symptoms like fearfulness and panic attacks. They also found out how these drugs worked through other chemicals in the brain. Overall, this study suggests that these drugs might be helpful treatments for people who suffer from stress-caused mood and mental issues. However, more research needs to be done before we know if these drugs would actually work for treating those kinds of problems. It's important to note that while this study used animal models, it did not test any human subjects directly. Therefore, more testing will need to be conducted before we can say whether or not these drugs should be prescribed to patients suffering from stress related mood and emotional problems. In addition, some of the drugs studied here may cause side effects such as stomach bleeding, so it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding if these medications are right for you or your loved ones. Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting new medication. Do not discontinue current medication without first consulting your doctor."
"Surrounding every living cell is a biological membrane that is largely impermeable to water-soluble molecules . This hydrophobic ( or “water-hating” ) barrier preserves the contents of the cell and also regulates how the cell interacts with its environment . This latter function is critical and relies on a class of proteins that are embedded within the membrane and are also hydrophobic . The hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins is however inconvenient for biochemical studies which usually take place in water-based solutions . Therefore , membrane proteins are under-represented in biological research compared to the water-soluble ones , even though roughly one quarter of a cell’s proteins are membrane proteins . Researchers have developed a few tricks to keep membrane proteins soluble after they have been extracted from the membrane . An old but popular technique makes use of detergents , which are chemicals with opposing hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties ( hydrophilic literally means “water-loving” ) . However , even mild detergents can damage membrane proteins and will sometimes lead to experimental artifacts . More recent tricks to stabilize membrane proteins without detergents have been described but remain laborious , costly or difficult to perform . To overcome these limitations , Carlson et al . developed a simple method to stabilize membrane proteins without detergent . Called the “peptidisc” , the method uses multiple copies of a unique peptide – a short sequence of the building blocks of protein – that had been redesigned to have optimal hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties . The idea was that the peptides would wrap around the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein , and shield them from the watery solution . Indeed , when Carlson et al . mixed this peptide with five different membrane proteins from bacteria , all were perfectly soluble and functional without detergent . The ideal ratio of peptide needed to form a peptidisc around each membrane protein was reached automatically , without having to test many different conditions . This indicates that the peptidisc acts like a “one size fits all” scaffold . The peptidisc is a new tool that will allow more researchers , including those who are not expert biochemists , to study membrane proteins . This will yield a better understanding of the structure of a cell’s membrane and how it interacts with the environment . Since the approach is both simple and easy to apply , more membrane proteins can now also be included in high-throughput searches for potential new drugs for various medical conditions ."," Membrane Proteins are important molecules that help cells function properly but they can be hard to study because they need special conditions to survive in. One way to keep them alive is by putting them inside little “baskets” called discs. These baskets are made from special kinds of proteins or chemicals. However, these baskts come in many shapes and sizes and can be complicated to make. In this study, scientists found a simpler way to make these bskets so that more people could use them easily. They did this by finding one kind of basket that works well for most types of membranes. This new type of basket is called a pepti disk. Scientists showed that this new basket worked just as well as the other ones and was much easier to make! Now, more people will be able to use these bsttions to study membrane protiens and learn more about how they work. This will help us understand how our bodies work better and maybe even find ways to treat diseases like cancer and heart disease. That's pretty amazing! Science is always coming up with new ways to help us live healthier lives. Who knows what cool things will happen next? Stay tuned to find out! 🔍"
"Most cells contain molecules of DNA that carry instructions to make the proteins cells need to perform different tasks . When a cell requires a certain protein , the corresponding DNA sequence is first transcribed into molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) known as transcripts . These sequences of RNA are then read by the cell and translated into the desired protein sequence . Errors in copying DNA before a cell divides , can lead to genetic mutations that affect the ability of the cell to carry out certain roles , influencing the overall ‘fitness’ of the cell . Similar to genetic mutations , errors that arise when forming RNA transcripts may also alter the tasks a cell performs . However , it is difficult to find out what kinds of errors cells have in their transcripts and how often these mistakes occur . This is because current methods for sequencing RNA are prone to technical inaccuracies that interfere with the ability to detect true transcript errors . Now , Li and Lynch have adapted a method for high-throughput sequencing of RNA , which can accurately identify transcript errors in Escherichia coli and other species of bacteria . The experiments showed that errors in RNA molecules occurred more frequently than genetic mutations in the same sequence of DNA . Li and Lynch also found that the transcripts contained more nonsense errors – that is , mutations which prematurely stop transcripts from being translated , resulting in shorter proteins – at the end of the RNA molecule than at the beginning or middle . It is possible that transcripts with errors at the beginning or the middle are more efficiently eliminated than those at the end , suggesting that bacteria have a quality-control mechanism for removing transcripts with premature stop sequences . These findings suggest that at any one-time cells carry thousands of transcripts with inaccuracies in their sequence , which likely impact the tasks cells perform . The next step will be to investigate how these different transcript errors affect the fitness of cells ."," Scientists found that there are many mistakes (errors) when copies of DNA molecules make copies of themselves or when they turn into RNA molecules. These mistakes happen very often and could change what the DNA or RNA says. Some of these mistakes might cause problems because they could change the proteins made by those genes. They also saw that some types of mistakes happened more often near the ends of the gene copying process. This suggests that cells may be checking their genes and getting rid of mistakes like this. Overall, scientists learned even more about how mistakes happen inside living things and how cells deal with them. This will help us understand why certain kinds of mistakes keep happening over and over again. It will also help us learn more about diseases caused by mistakes in our own bodies. We still don’t know enough though, so more work needs to be done. More studies on different organisms need to be performed to see whether other organisms behave similarly. In addition, it would be interesting to study how these mechanisms affect the evolution of genomes. Finally, it will be important to determine the biological significance of these processes. For example, do they allow rapid adaptation? Or do they lead to disease states? Further investigation is needed to answer these questions. Future experiments should focus on identifying the specific enzyme(s) responsible for causing these errors and determining where within the cellular machinery these errors originate."
"The loss of a limb will have a profound impact on an individual’s daily life . Nevertheless , individuals can employ a variety of behavioural strategies to adapt to the loss of , say , a hand . Some become skilled at using the residual part of their arm , while others prefer to rely on their other hand . Their brain , too , will undergo major changes . Many studies have shown that the region of the brain that controlled a given limb can be “taken over” by another part of the body if that limb is lost . This process has been previously considered to be harmful , as it has been linked to experiences of pain arising from the missing limb . Now , Makin et al . have explored the links between changes in the behaviour of individuals missing a hand and changes in their brains . People who had been born without a hand or who had lost a hand in later life were asked to wear a device that recorded their movements as they went about their daily lives . The data revealed that people who had been born without a hand made relatively more use of their residual limb , while those who had lost their hand made relatively more use of their remaining hand . Moreover , these differences were reflected in patterns of brain activity . In the subjects born without a hand ( who were making relatively extensive use of their residual limb ) , the area of the brain that would otherwise control the ‘missing’ hand was activated when the subjects moved their residual limb . And in the subjects who had lost their hand , this brain region was activated when they moved their remaining hand . However , in individual subjects , the size of the effect depended on the usage preferences of the subject: for example , the minority of people who were born without a hand but nevertheless make extensive use of their intact hand showed a pattern of activation that resembled the average pattern seen in those who had lost a hand in later life . By providing new insights into the plasticity of brain and behaviour following the loss of a hand , the work of Makin et al . may aid the development of rehabilitation techniques to help patients to optimise the use of both their residual and their intact limbs ."," This study looked into what happens when people lose a body part through amputations. It found out that there are two main reasons why this could lead to changes in the brain. Firstly, losing a body parts means losing some senses such as touch and temperature. Secondly, it also means using that particular body part less often than before. Researchers have mainly studied the first reason so far but not the second one. They wanted to see if the way people used their remaining body parts afterwards was important too. To do this, they asked 12 people who had lost arms due to accidents or illnesses and 8 people who were born without arms about how much they used their other hand and arm compared to others. Then they did MRI scans and measured the amount of times each person moved their hand or arm during the day. Finally, they checked how well connected different areas of the brain were. Their results showed that those who used their good hand more tended to have stronger connections between the missing arm area of the right side of the front of the head and the left side of their brain where movement is controlled. These findings suggest that both losing a sense and changing the way you move your body can affect the brain even years later. This shows us that our brains keep adapting even after injury."
"For many aquatic creatures , the red blood cells that rush through their bodies are created in organs such as the liver or the kidney . In most land vertebrates however , blood-cell production occurs in the bone marrow . There , the process is shielded from the ultraviolet light or starker temperature changes experienced out of the water . It is possible that this difference evolved long before the first animal with a backbone crawled out of the aquatic environment and faced new , harsher conditions: yet very little fossil evidence exists to support this idea . A definitive answer demands a close examination of fossils from the water-to-land transition including lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . To support the production of red blood cells , their fin and limb bones would have needed an internal cavity that can house a specific niche that opens onto a complex network of blood vessels . To investigate this question , Estefa et al . harnessed the powerful x-ray beam produced by the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and imaged the fin and limb bones from fossil lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . The resulting three-dimensional structures revealed spongy long bones with closed internal cavities where the bone marrow cells were probably entrapped . These could not have housed the blood vessels needed to create an environment that produces red blood cells . In fact , the earliest four-legged land animals Estefa et al . found with an open marrow cavity lived 60 million years after vertebrates had first emerged from the aquatic environment , suggesting that blood cells only began to be created in bone marrow after the water-to-land transition . Future work could help to pinpoint exactly when the change in blood cell production occurred , helping researchers to identify the environmental and biological factors that drove this change ."," Scientists have studied how different animals make their own red blood cells inside their bodies. Some animals do this in special organs called spleens, while other animals do it in certain parts of their bones called bone marrows. Researchers think that some animals started making red blood cell in their bones instead of their spleen because it was safer there. To test this idea, scientists looked at the way bones made red blood in different kinds of animals. They used two ways to look at the bones: cutting them up into pieces and looking at them under a microscope or using x-ray beams to see through the whole bone without having to cut it open. By doing this, they found out that some ancient animal groups already had bones that could safely store red blood, even before animals lived mostly on land. This means that making red cells in bones might not have happened when animals moved from living in water to living on land! Now we know more about how different kinds animals make red blood today. We also learned something new about what kind of bones some early ancestors had. It will be interesting to learn more about why those early ancestors decided to use their bones like this! What do you think? Isn't it cool to learn new things about how animals live and grow?"
"The connection between stress and alcohol use is highly complex . On one hand , there is the idea of having a drink to ‘steady the nerves’ . On the other hand , in alcoholics , abnormal responses to stress often accompany heavy drinking . In this case , it remains unknown whether stress cause excessive drinking , or vice versa . Areas of the brain that normally help respond to stress work differently in long-term , heavy drinkers . One example is a structure called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) , which is over-active in anxiety disorders and is also associated with some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal . The mechanism behind both problems is thought to be a specific ‘signaling system’ that is activated by a small molecule called dynorphin . Previous research into the effects of dynorphin was performed either in the context of alcoholism or of anxiety disorders , but it was not known if there was a connection between the two . Therefore , Hwa et al . wanted to determine how prolonged alcohol use might affect responses to stress , and whether dynorphin signaling plays a role . To model long-term alcohol use in the laboratory , a group of mice was given free access to alcohol every other day , ensuring that they developed the mouse equivalent of a drinking habit . After six weeks , these ‘heavy drinkers’ went through a period of abstinence , mimicking alcohol withdrawal . Then , the mice were stressed by exposing them to a chemical that smelled like a fox , one of the mice’s predators in the wild . When mice smell predators , they normally respond by fleeing from the area and digging up debris to defend itself . As expected , the control mice in this study , which did not drink alcohol , did just that . In contrast , the heavy drinkers largely ignored the predator scent by not digging and even spent time hanging around the area that smelled like the predator . Blocking dynorphin-induced signaling in the alcoholic mice , either using a drug or by deleting the gene that codes for dynorphin , reset the stress response to normal , allowing these mice to avoid the predator and dig as normal . Furthermore , measuring the electrical activity in the brain revealed that the BNST was abnormally active in alcohol-drinking mice , driven by signals from another part of the brain , the prefrontal cortex . This reveals part of the circuitry in the brain responsible for the connection between alcohol withdrawal and the stress response . These results shed new light on the biological mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alcohol use and stress . In the future , these could be used to determine why heavy drinking can overlap with anxiety disorders , or to develop new treatments that would help recovering alcoholics cope better with stress ."," Alcohol can cause people to feel more stressed than those who don't drink alcohol. This study looked at how alcohol affects how animals respond to being exposed to a predator smell. They found that when animals were exposed to the predator scent after they had been drinking heavily, their brains responded differently compared to animals that hadn’t drunk much or no alcohol. When these animals didn’t have a part of their brain called the Bed Nucleus of Striatal Terminals (BNST) anymore, they did not react strongly to the smell like the other groups did. To make sure it was only the BSNF region causing this effect, researchers used special chemicals to turn off parts of the brain. If they turned off the part of the BNSF region connected to another area of the animal’s brain called Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), then the animals acted less scared even though they had previously been exposed to lots of alcohol. Overall, this study shows that there might be different ways to treat someone who has problems dealing with stress because of drinking too much alcohol. It also suggests that scientists could look at the BNF and PFC regions of the mouse brain to see if they change in people who are having trouble coping with stress due to drinking too many alcoholic drinks."
"Living cells must be able to withstand changes in the environment . For example , if there is a sudden increase in temperature—which could damage proteins or other molecules—most cells can respond with the ‘heat shock response’ . In humans and other mammals , a single protein called heat shock factor 1 triggers the production of numerous heat shock proteins that protect the cell from the detrimental effects of high temperatures . Most heat shock proteins protect cells by binding to , and stabilizing , other molecules in the cell; this prevents these molecules from being damaged or from aggregating and allows them to continue to function as normal . A protein called eEF1A1 is involved in the final stages of protein production and also enhances the function of heat shock factor 1 during the heat shock response . To make a protein , an enzyme called RNA polymerase transcribes DNA in the nucleus of the cell into a messenger RNA molecule that then exits the nucleus and binds to a ribosome . This molecular machine then translates the messenger RNA sequence into a protein by joining together individual building blocks called amino acids in the correct order . Like other elongation factors , eEF1A1 helps to select the amino acids that match the sequence of the messenger RNA template . However , it was unclear how eEF1A1 helped to protect cells during the heat shock response . Nudler et al . have now engineered cells—from humans and mice—that make less of the eEF1A1 protein than normal . These cells had enough of this protein to support their growth and development under normal conditions , but not enough to help during the heat shock response . When these cells are subjected to a sudden increase in temperature , they fail to produce a sufficient amount of major heat shock proteins . Heat shock factor 1 is needed to transcribe the genes that encode these heat shock proteins , and Nudler et al . found that eEF1A1 must bind to heat shock factor 1 and then to a moving RNA polymerase for these genes to be transcribed efficiently . Moreover , the eEF1A1 protein was shown to bind to and stabilize the heat shock proteins' messenger RNAs , and aid their export from the nucleus and their binding to the ribosome . These newly discovered roles for eEF1A1 during the heat shock response highlight this elongation factor as a promising drug target for treating diseases where protein folding goes awry , for example in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease . In adults , neurons do not make enough eEF1A1 , and Nudler et al . suggest that enabling these cells to make more of this protein could help to treat a range of neurodegenerative conditions ."," This study found that a specific type of protein called eEF-1A helps control how our body responds when under extreme heat. When exposed to high temperatures, our bodies need to make special proteins quickly so they can help us survive. To do this, another kind of protein, called HSF-1, tells our genes to start making these special proteinsthey're called ""stress"" or ""emergency"" proteins because we only make them when we really need to. But there's just one problem: it takes too long for the HSF protein to get inside the cell's main machine that actually makes proteins, which is called the ribosome. That means we might not be able to make enough emergency proteins fast enough to keep ourselves safe. So what happens? Another protein, eEF–1A, comes along and helps guide the HSf protein into the right place. Once it gets there, the Hsf protein can tell the ribsometo start making those important emergency proteinthe ones we need to stay alive. Without eEF‐1A helping out, our cells won’t be ableto respond as quickly or effectively to heat stress. It also means we won’thave enough of those important proteins around to protect us."
"Plants form new structures such as flowers or branches throughout their life as they develop and grow . However , most plant cells are not able to produce a new flower or branch because the genes involved in these processes are usually switched off . The genes are found in regions of chromatin—the structure in which DNA is packaged in plant cells—that are normally tightly packed . This packing prevents other proteins called transcription factors from accessing the DNA and switching the genes on . New flowers form from cells that contain high levels of a plant hormone called auxin . In these cells , a protein called MONOPTEROS switches on genes involved in making flowers . How the structure of the chromatin that surrounds these genes is altered so that they can be switched on is not clear . Wu , Yamaguchi , Xiao et al . studied this question in a plant known as Arabidopsis . The experiments show that MONOPTEROS plays a crucial role in altering the structure of chromatin to allow flowers to form . In the presence of high levels of auxin , MONOPTEROS recruits groups of proteins called SWI/SNF remodeling complexes to regions of chromatin that contain genes involved in flower formation . These protein complexes loosen the structure of the chromatin so that genes can be switched on by transcription factors . Wu , Yamaguchi , Xiao et al . 's findings suggest that auxin , with the help of MONOPTEROS and the SWI/SNF remodeling complexes , enables flower formation by changing the chromatin state . They further suggest that this chromatin state switch is also involved in leaf formation and other processes in plants that are controlled by MONOPTEROS and auxin ."," Scientists have discovered a way that plants use a chemical called ""auxin"" to change which genes get turned on or off in cells. When auxin levels go up, it causes certain genes to turn on. These genes help make flowers. To do this, another protein (MONOPTEROUS) helps open up the DNA so these genes can turn on when needed. However, if there isn't enough auxin around, other proteins bind to MONOTPTEROS and keep the DNA closed, so those same genes don't turn on at all. This allows plants to make more and more flowers as they grow. It shows how plants can use one kind of chemical signal to control different things happening inside their cells. It also gives us ideas about how chemicals might work in our own bodies too. For example, maybe some chemicals could help keep certain genes turned off even after they should be turned back on again. That would be useful for treating diseases like cancer where certain genes shouldn't be active anymore once treatment starts. Or perhaps chemicals could find ways to only turn on specific sets of genes instead of many groups of genes at once, which would be helpful for treating autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. So while this study was done using plants, it still has important lessons for understanding human health!"
"Stem cells in the bone marrow are essential for creating new blood cells . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) is a common type of blood cancer in the elderly that occurs when blood cells fail to develop normally . Depending on which types of blood cells are affected , individuals with MDS may bleed more easily , feel weak and tired , or be unable to effectively fight off infections . Animals and plants store their genetic information in the form of chromosomes . Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes , with one copy inherited from the mother , and the other from the father . The bone marrow cells of many people with MDS delete a section from one of their copies of chromosome 7 . As this section contains many different genes , it is difficult to fully understand which specific genes contribute to the development of MDS when one copy is lost . Wong et al . have now genetically engineered mice to lack a section of one of their copies of chromosome 7 that is often missing in patients with MDS . Bone marrow cells from these mice exhibit many of the same abnormalities found in human MDS . For example , most of the immature blood stem cells expand , but these stem cells do not correctly specialize into mature blood cells—in particular , not enough immune cells are produced . The developing blood cells also have problems expressing several genes , including one that helps to protect the cells from damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species . These problems worsen as the mice age . These mice provide the first evidence directly linking the missing section of chromosome 7 to abnormalities found in MDS patients . Future studies using the mice will advance our understanding of how the loss of this section of chromosome 7 interacts with other genes involved in MDS to alter the course of this disease and how it responds to treatment ."," Myelodystrophy Syndrome (MDS) is a type of bone marrow disorder where blood cells do not develop properly. This can lead to anemia or other problems such as bleeding or infection. One common cause of this disease is having too many copies of certain parts of Chromosomes 1, 6, or 7. In particular, some people have too few copies of part of Chrosome Seven. Researchers wanted to learn more about how this affects MDS. They used special mice that had fewer copies of one specific area on Chromsome 7 than normal. These mice showed signs similar to what doctors see in patients with MDS, including changes in their blood counts and higher risk of developing cancer. When these mice were put into a stressful situation, they also developed MDS faster. Overall, this study shows that having fewer copies on a specific part of chromsome 8 may be linked to MSD. It also suggests that MDS might be caused by both genetic factors and environmental conditions. More work needs to be done to understand exactly how this works before we know if it could help us treat MDS better. However, this research gives us new clues to follow up on."
"In the nervous system , a network of specialized neurons—known as the somatosensory system—carries information about sensations including touch , muscle position , temperature and pain . Distinct sets of somatosensory neurons are thought to carry information about the different types of sensations . In young animals , the precise switching on , or ‘expression’ , of genes controls the formation of the network of neurons . However , it is not known exactly which genes are expressed in what types of neurons , where , or when . Here , Chiu et al . used a technique called flow cytometry using different fluorescent markers to isolate a group of cells called Dorsal Root Ganglion ( DRG ) neurons in mice . These neurons have long thread-like fibers that extend from the spinal cord to the skin , muscles and joints all over the body . These fibers carry sensory information to the spinal cord , where it can be relayed to the brain and processed . The experiments compared three distinct types of DRG neuron and found that they differed in their ability to send information to other cells . Chiu et al . analyzed the expression of all the genes in the three types of DRG neurons . Each type of neuron had distinct groups of genes that were being expressed . Also , several genes that are known to be important for sensation were expressed at different levels in the different types of cells . Next , large numbers of single cells were analyzed to find out the finer details about the three types of neuron . These findings made it possible to further divide the DRG neurons into six distinct subsets that matched previously known groups of somatosensory neurons , and also identified new ones . Chiu et al . 's findings reveal the complexity and diversity of the neurons involved in carrying information about sensations towards the brain . This is an important step in classifying the nervous system , and uncovers many genes previously not linked to sensation . The next challenges lie in understanding how the expression of these genes in each type of neuron relates to their unique roles ."," This study aimed to understand how different types of sensory nerve cells work together to help us feel things like pain or pressure. To do this, researchers took samples from mice and separated out groups of these nerve cells based on their properties. They then analyzed each group separately using special techniques that allowed them to measure the genes being expressed in each type of nerve cell. By doing so, they found that there were even more differences between some of these groups than previously thought. Overall, this study provides important new insights into how different kinds of nerve cells contribute to our sense of touch. It also suggests that future studies should look closer at the roles played by certain types of nerve tissue when it comes to detecting painful or uncomfortable stimuli. Understanding more about these processes could lead to better treatments for people who have problems with sensation due to conditions such as diabetes or neuropathic pain. In addition, knowing more about how these various nerve cells interact with one another may reveal ways to improve existing prosthetic limbs or develop new ones that can be controlled more effectively by the brain. Finally, studying the mechanisms behind somatosensing might also shed light on other aspects of human behavior, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. Further investigations along these lines could provide valuable insights into many areas of health science and neuroscience research."
"Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , giving 46 chromosomes in total . When a cell divides , it typically copies all its chromosomes and distributes the copies equally between the two new cells , so that they also have 46 chromosomes . Cells in the reproductive organs undergo a special division process called meiosis , which halves the number of chromosomes . As a result , sperm and eggs have just 23 chromosomes , and so when they combine , the fertilized egg receives a complete set of 46 chromosomes . A similar process happens in all species that use sexual reproduction . As the chromosomes prepare to separate , they line up side by side in matching pairs . During this period , DNA from one chromosome will swap with DNA from its partner . These events are called “crossovers , ” and because such exchanges can happen at many locations along the chromosomes , no two sperm or eggs are the same . Historic studies in fruit flies revealed that chromosomes do not mix their DNA at random . After one crossover occurs , it is less likely that another will happen , and if there are two crossovers , the second one tends be far away from the first . This suggests that there must be a signal that tells the chromosomes about the exchange . However , the nature of the signals and how they are communicated along pairs of chromosomes remain mysterious . A structure called the “synaptonemal complex” holds chromosomes together while they mix their DNA . In 2017 , researchers found that this structure behaves like a liquid crystal: its molecules are organized into a regular , repeating pattern , but they move freely , like a fluid . If signals could move through this material , this might explain how information spreads along paired chromosomes . Now , Zhang et al . – including two researchers involved in the 2017 work – identify some of the signals in the small roundworm , Caenorhabditis elegans , as four related proteins named ZHPs . When tagged with fluorescent markers and followed under a microscope , all four ZHP proteins moved to the liquid crystal-like synaptonemal complex during meiosis . Depleting the proteins at this crucial time revealed their roles . Two of the proteins are needed for chromosomes to mix their DNA , while the other two control the number of exchanges between each pair of chromosomes . Successful meiosis depended upon all four ZHPs , and so too did the fertility of the worms . The next step is to find the other molecules that interact with the ZHP proteins during meiosis . Since similar proteins appear in other species , including humans , this could help to reveal more about how genetic traits from our parents mix and match . In the future , studies that build on these findings could also help scientists to understand how errors in these processes give rise to birth defects and infertility ."," Meiosis is when cells divide into gametes or sex cells. During meioses, pairs of chromosomal strands called homologues need to exchange genetic material with each other through a special type of DNA break called a crosser over. This helps ensure that the two copies of each gene on different chromosomic strands end up going to different gametes. However, there are rules about how many times this can happen per chromosomeric pair, and where exactly it happens. Scientists have found some clues about how these rules might work using worms. They discovered four proteins that seem to help make sure the right amount of crossing overs happen in the right places. All four proteings seemed to be involved in making crossers happen, and they all seemed to do something related to marking certain parts of the chromosmeres so that crossers would only happen in those marked areas. It's not totally clear yet what each protein does, but together they seem to set up a system that marks out spots on the chromsomeres where crossers will happen. Then, once the crossers have happened, another group of proteins takes over to finish the process. Overall, this study gives us more pieces of the puzzle about how the rules for crossing overs are made during meiosesis."
"New cells are made when a single cell duplicates its DNA and divides into two cells , distributing the DNA equally between them , in a process called mitosis . The splitting of the two copies of DNA happens through a series of controlled events known as mitotic exit . Previous research has suggested that mitotic exit relies on both the destruction of specific proteins and the removal of tags called phosphate groups from other proteins . Phosphate groups modify how proteins behave and their removal can trigger changes in a protein’s activity . Although protein destruction and phosphate group removal were known to be important to mitotic exit , it was not understood how they are coordinated in the cell to ensure the correct order of events . Holder et al . have used a technique called mass spectrometry to monitor the level of thousands of proteins , and any tags attached to them , during mitotic exit in human cells grown in the laboratory . The experiments revealed that the destruction of a single protein , known as cyclin B , plays a major role in triggering subsequent events . The removal of cyclin B activates enzymes known as phosphatases , which remove phosphate groups from proteins . Phosphatases then act on a wide range of proteins in a specific order that depends on the environment surrounding the phosphate group . This ‘chain’ of phosphatase activity determines the order of events during mitotic exit . The findings of Holder et al . contribute to the basic understanding of how mitotic exit works . Errors in the process can affect the stability of a cell’s genome , contributing to diseases such as cancer . In the future , this may help to identify what goes wrong in these cases and potential avenues for developing treatments ."," Scientists have studied how cells divide (mitosis) using different methods such as looking at which proteins change over time. They found that certain proteins were broken down quickly while others were broken done slowly. By breaking down one specific protein first, this caused another protein to break down next. This chain reaction helped control when cells divided. These findings help us understand more about cell division. In the future, scientists can use this knowledge to better understand what happens when things go wrong during cell division in diseases like cancer. For example, they could find ways to make the proteins break down faster so that cells would stop dividing. Or they could figure out why some proteins aren't breaking down fast enough and fix that problem instead. Overall, this study helps us learn more about how cells work and how to potentially treat diseases related to cell division problems. It also shows us how powerful new tools like ""high temporal resolution proteomcs"" can be used to discover new things about science!

"Around 16% of people will experience an episode of major depression at some point in their lives , with symptoms including a loss of motivation , a reduced enjoyment of previously pleasurable activities , and disturbances in sleep and appetite . Multiple genes and environmental factors have been implicated in depression , and one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disorder is exposure to stress . Stress and depression affect many of the same brain regions , most notably the prefrontal cortex—an area that is involved in decision making , problem solving and regulating emotions . Shrestha et al . therefore reasoned that a good way of obtaining insights into the relationship between stress and depression would be to study prefrontal cortex cells that express genes that have been linked to depression . One such gene is Wfs1 . Mutations in this gene cause a rare disorder called Wolfram syndrome , in which affected individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that often include severe depression . Shrestha et al . identified a specific population of cells in the prefrontal cortex that express Wfs1 . When subjected to a stressful event , such as being restrained , mice that had been genetically modified to lack this gene in their prefrontal cortex were more likely to exhibit depression-like behaviors than non-modified mice . The genetically modified mice also released more stress hormones when restrained and produced different amounts of a number of proteins that regulate the growth and signaling of neurons . Shrestha et al . propose that these proteins act on neural circuits that control how the mice respond to stress . Furthermore , changes in the levels or the distribution of these proteins may increase the likelihood that a stressful event will trigger behaviors associated with depression . Further experiments are required to investigate the possibility that using drugs to manipulate cells that express Wfs1 could protect against the harmful effects of stress , or even treat existing episodes of depression ."," This study found that when certain genes were removed from specific brain cells called layer 5/6 pyramid neurons located in an area of the brain called the medulla oblongata, it led to changes in how well those cells worked. These changes caused problems with how well the body dealt with stress. When this happened, there was also a change in how much of another chemical called CRH was made in the brain. Because of these findings, researchers now know more about why some people might get sicker than others if they experience too much stress. However, further studies need to be done before scientists fully understand what exactly happens during this process. For example, future work could try to figure out which other chemicals play a role in helping to control how well our bodies deal with stressful events. By learning more about all of these things, doctors might one day be able to better help people who struggle with stress-related health issues. In addition, understanding more about how different parts of the body communicate with each other during times of stress could lead to new ways to treat diseases like depression. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how stress affects our brains and bodies, and suggests potential targets for developing new treatments for related conditions. It will be interesting to see how these findings impact future research and potentially improve patient outcomes."
"Proteins play a wide variety of roles in the cell and interact with many other molecules . The behavior of proteins depends on their structure; yet , proteins are often flexible and will change shape , much like a tree in the wind . Nevertheless , for some of the activities that it performs , a protein must adopt one specific shape . Therefore , the likelihood that the protein will take on this specific shape directly determines how efficiently that protein can perform a specific job . The shape of a protein can be regulated by changes at several levels; these could include modifying one of the amino acid building blocks that make up that protein , binding to another protein , or by placing the protein in a part of the cell that is crowded with other large molecules . Schmid and Hugel wanted to understand how these three different types of regulation affect the structure of a protein and how they relate to its activities . The protein Hsp90 was used as a test case . It typically exists with two copies of the protein bound together , either in a parallel or a V-shape . Hsp90 plays several important roles in metabolism and can break down molecules of ATP , the so-called energy currency of the cell . All three types of regulation favored the Hsp90 pairs taking the parallel structure and increased its breakdown of ATP . The results suggest that the Hsp90 pair has a flexible structure , and that reducing this flexibility can improve Hsp90’s efficiency in carrying out its role . It was particularly unexpected that the large-scale , unspecific effect of placing the protein in a crowded environment could have such similar results to a small-scale , precise change of a single amino acid within the protein . While all three forms of regulation help to stabilize the parallel structure for Hsp90 , they do this through different mechanisms , which influence the speed and the way that the protein transitions between the two structures . Schmid and Hugel believe that these results offer a new perspective on how diversely the shape and function of proteins is controlled at the molecular level , which could have wider implications for medical diagnostics and treatment ."," Proteins play important roles inside cells, but they can also be harmful if their functions get out of control. To prevent this from happening, cells use various methods to control protein activity. One way is called ""fine tuning,"" whereby cells adjust the amount of certain chemicals attached to a particular type of protein. Another method involves changing the shape of the protein itself. In this study, researchers used a technique called single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to examine how these two mechanisms work together to control the activity of a group of proteases called heat shock proteins 90 (HSP90). They found that both types of regulation occur simultaneously, but in unexpected ways. Specifically, they discovered that some regulatory events happen only within small regions of the proteins, while others take place across the entire structure. This suggests that there may be multiple ways to control a protein's activity depending on its location within the cell. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into how cells maintain proper protein function and offer potential targets for therapeutic interventions aimed at treating diseases associated with abnormal protein activity, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. It is worth noting that smFRET is an advanced imaging technology that allows scientists to track individual molecules over time and measure subtle changes in their properties. By doing so, it provides detailed information about the behavior of proteasomes and other biological structures at the molecular level."
"The cells of fungi and other eukaryotic organisms are generally asymmetric in shape and structure . This is possible because newly-formed cells can establish front and back ends that influence how each cell grows and develops . A protein called Cdc42 – which can cycle between an active and inactive form – establishes this cell “polarity” . The front of the cell is specified by the accumulation of active Cdc42 proteins in a small area of the membrane that surrounds the cell . However , it is not clear why the accumulation of active Cdc42 only happens in one place . Budding yeast is widely used as a model to study cell polarity . This yeast reproduces through the budding of new daughter cells out of one end of the mother cell . To achieve this , the mother establishes a single front end through the accumulation of active Cdc42 . This marks the site where the daughter cell will emerge . Previous research has shown that during the early stages of cell polarization , Cdc42 clusters start to form at several places on the inner surface of the membrane . Only a single cluster emerges as the winner , while the others lose and shrink away . How does this happen ? One possibility is that Cdc42 clusters all compete with each other to attract polarity proteins from the cell interior , so that when a protein falls off one cluster it can be picked up by another . Another possibility is that the winning cluster acquires a factor that stabilizes it , while the other clusters do not . Here , Wu et al . use microscopy and mathematical modelling to distinguish between these two possible scenarios in budding yeast . The experiments show that the speed of competition can be manipulated by altering how quickly key polarity proteins move between the membrane and the interior of the cell . Cells with slowed competition can maintain multiple fronts for long enough to make several buds at the same time . Wu et al . ’s findings suggest that the formation of a single front in budding yeast is due to competition for polarity factors . The next challenge will be to understand how some cells in animals and other fungi manage to suppress this competition in order to produce more than one front ."," Scientists have found that when some cells divide into two parts or ""bud"", there needs to be just one part where certain molecules called polarity markers start out on one side more than on the other side. These molecules help guide the division process. Sometimes, these molecules might start off unevenly distributed on both sides of the dividing cell. To solve this problem, the scientists discovered that the extra molecule on each side competes with itself to attract more molecules to its side. This helps choose just one side to become the future new part of the divided cell. It's like choosing who gets to sit at the round table first! The scientists also showed that if you change the number of molecules available to compete, it changes whether one side wins over the other or not. So now we know why having an odd number of these molecule groups (like 3) helps decide which side will win and get to be the new part. Just like if you had three apples and someone took one away, there would be only two left, so one apple left is easier to eat than two apples left! We hope that explanation helped you understand what happens during cell division. Science is amazing because we can learn about things happening inside our bodies that we never knew about before!"
"The DNA molecules in cells are continuously bombarded with radiation , chemicals and other agents , and it is important for cells to repair the damage caused by these before the process of cell division begins . Most DNA molecules consist of two single strands of DNA that are held together by hydrogen bonds in the familiar double-helix structure . Of the various types of damage that DNA molecules are prone to , double-strand breaks are among the most dangerous because they can lead to cancer if they are not repaired . DNA molecules use four bases—adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine—to store genetic information . In single-stranded DNA these bases are attached to a backbone made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups . A crucial feature of double-stranded DNA is that the sequences of bases in the two strands are complementary to each other—adenine is always paired with thymine , and cytosine is always paired with guanine . However , the hydrogen bonds that hold the pairs of bases together are quite weak , which means that the two strands of the double helix can be pulled apart quite easily . The ease with which these bonds can be formed and broken is crucial for many genetic processes . One way to repair a double strand break is to replace the damaged stretch of DNA with an undamaged stretch from another DNA molecule . This process of swapping DNA molecules , which is called strand exchange , is catalyzed by a protein that is able to interact with two DNA molecules at the same time . An important first step within this process is identifying the stretch of DNA that can be used to repair the break . Ragunathan et al . now report evidence from experiments on Escherichia coli that support a model in which the protein catalyst ( RecA in the case of E . coli ) combines with a single strand of DNA to form a filamentous DNA–protein complex ( RecA filament ) that can then slide along a double-stranded DNA molecule to search for a complementary sequence of base pairs . High-resolution fluorescent imaging reveals that the RecA filament is able to sample several hundred base pairs before the filament dissociates from the DNA and rebinds at a different location . The sliding was largely driven by electrostatic interactions between the RecA filament and the double-stranded DNA , and the filament was capable of identifying matching sequences that contained as few as six matching bases . Ragunathan et al . estimate that sliding is about two orders of magnitude faster at finding matching sequences compared to mechanisms that do not involve sliding , such as models that rely solely on chance encounters between DNA molecules and the RecA filament . By showing that a DNA–protein complex can slide along another DNA molecule to search for a target , these results could lead to new insights into other systems in which it is necessary for protein-nucleic acid complexes to locate a particular sequence of bases ."," Scientists have studied how bacteria repair their broken DNA using proteins called RecAs. They found out that these proteins make a special structure called “filaments” when they bind onto one strand of a broken piece of DNA. These filaments then move around looking for the other matching strand so it can fix the breakage. This movement happens because the filaments can slide across the surface of the DNA while searching for the match. By moving around, the filamentoius can find what it's looking for faster than if it just sat still. The scientists also figured out that even if there isn't a perfect match, the protein might still stick around and try to fix things anyway. That means that sometimes mistakes could get fixed too! But don't worry – most of the time everything turns out okay. So next time you feel like your life is falling apart, remember this story and know that everything will work out in the end! Just keep calm and carry on...or maybe slide on over to someone else instead. It really doesn't matter either way; you'll probably end up meeting who you need to meet eventually. And hey, at least now we all know why those little RecA critters were always running back and forth between people's houses in the neighborhood. Kinda creepy, but also pretty cool I guess."
"To produce a protein from a gene , the gene must first be transcribed to make a molecule of RNA . In general , the enzyme building the RNA molecule stops building when it reaches the end of a gene and encounters a termination signal . When a virus replicates , however , it needs to transcribe all the genes in its genome , so it relies on antiterminator proteins to make the enzyme building the RNA ignore the termination signal . Therefore , medicines that stop antiterminators working could stop viral infections spreading . Human metapneumovirus ( HMPV ) can cause severe respiratory infections in children , the elderly and people with weakened immune systems . A protein called M2-1 that is found inside HMPV must be present for the virus to infect humans , and it was recently shown that this protein plays a role in antitermination in a virus closely related to HMPV . Using a range of techniques , including X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations , Leyrat et al . worked out the structure of M2-1 in HMPV , and showed that it can flip between ‘open’ and ‘closed’ forms . The open structure presents surfaces that could be targeted by antiviral drugs . When M2-1 binds to RNA , the closed structure is stabilized as a result of the RNA binding to two separate sites on the protein . Leyrat et al . suggest that similar antiterminator proteins in related viruses—including respiratory syncytial virus , Marburg and Ebola—could also bind in this way . Leyrat et al . also propose a model describing how M2-1 can recognize the end of a gene , which could help with the development of new antiviral treatments ."," In this study, researchers have found that a certain type of protein called M2 can help viruses make more copies of their genetic material. This protein has been studied before, but now scientists know how it works at a very detailed level. They also understand what parts of the protein are important for its function. These new insights will likely be useful for developing better ways to treat or prevent infection from viruses like those being studied here. It may even lead to finding treatments against other viruses as well. Overall, this work helps us learn more about how viruses use proteins to control their own reproduction. By understanding these processes, we can potentially find ways to stop them from making more copies and spreading throughout our bodies. This could eventually lead to safer and more effective treatments for patients infected with various types of viruses. Further studies on related topics might provide additional knowledge that would further improve our ability to fight off viral infections. For example, future research could investigate whether similar mechanisms exist in other types of organisms such as bacteria or fungi. Such discoveries could reveal novel targets for drug development and contribute to the advancement of medical science. Additionally, studying the interactions between host cells and viruses using cutting-edge technologies such as cryo-electron microscopy could shed light on previously unknown aspects of virus replication cycles."
"In cells , worn out proteins and other unnecessary materials are sent to small compartments called lysosomes to be broken down and recycled . Lysosomes contain many different proteins including some that break down waste material into recyclable fragments and others that transport the fragments out of the lysosome . If any of these proteins do not work , waste products build up and cause disease . There are around 70 such lysosomal storage diseases , each arising from a different lysosomal protein not working correctly . A recently developed “nanodevice” called Clensor can measure the levels of chloride ions inside cells . Clensor is constructed from DNA , and its fluorescence changes when it detects chloride ions . Although chloride ions have many biological roles , chloride ion levels had not been measured inside a living organism . Now , Chakraborty et al . – including some of the researchers who developed Clensor – have used this nanodevice to examine chloride ion levels in the lysosomes of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans . This revealed that the lysosomes contain high levels of chloride ions . Furthermore , reducing the amount of chloride in the lysosomes made them worse at breaking down waste . Do lysosomes affected by lysosome storage diseases also contain low levels of chloride ions ? To find out , Chakraborty et al . used Clensor to study C . elegans worms and mouse and human cells whose lysosomes accumulate waste products . In all these cases , the levels of chloride in the diseased lysosomes were much lower than normal . This had a number of effects on how the lysosomes worked , such as reducing the activity of key lysosomal proteins . Chakraborty et al . also found that Clensor can be used to distinguish between different lysosomal storage diseases . This means that in the future , Clensor ( or similar methods that directly measure chloride ion levels in lysosomes ) may be useful not just for research purposes . They may also be valuable for diagnosing lysosomal storage diseases early in infancy that , if left undiagnosed , are fatal ."," Lysosoms are small sacs inside cells that help break down waste products and recycle materials. When these lysossms don't work properly it can lead to diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. To study how lysssoms work, scientists used special molecules called reporters to look at what happens inside them. They found out that there was more chlorine inside lyssoisms than outside. This high level of chlorinse helped lysissoms do their job. But when they lowered this level of clohrine, the lsysoisms could not do their jobs properly. This shows us that having the right amount of chlrorine inside our bodies is important for good health. It also tells us that if someone has too little chlorne inside their lysosisms, then they might get sick. Scientists now know that they can use this new knowledge about chlorinses to make better treatments for people who have lyssism problems. This will be very helpful!.

"Gaze following—working out where someone else is looking , and then switching your attention to that position—is an important part of social behavior and learning . Additionally , it is thought to be an important step towards recognizing that others have a mind of their own . Humans mostly use eye position to work out the ‘gaze direction’ of someone else , whereas non-human primates rely instead on the orientation of the face . However , the neural circuits that control gaze following are thought to be similar in both . Gaze following is a complex process that requires the brain to process a lot of different information . A face must be recognized , and its orientation worked out . A series of complex geometrical calculations must then be performed to work out the direction of the gaze , and how this relates to the position of the observer . Finally , the object of interest needs to be recognized and the attention of the observer focused on it . In the monkey brain , there are six interconnected areas called face patch regions that respond when a monkey is shown a face . However , researchers do not understand how monkeys translate the information about face orientation gathered by these regions into information about where to look during gaze following . Marciniak et al . performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on monkeys to track the flow of blood to different regions of the brain—the higher the blood flow , the more that area of the brain is working . To identify the location of their face patch regions , the monkeys first looked at faces . When the monkeys then performed a gaze following task , a region of the brain close to—but not overlapping—the face patches was activated . Marciniak et al . suggest this is the ‘gaze following patch’ where the brain performs the demanding calculations to translate face orientation into a position to look at . As gaze following is important in social interactions , understanding the neural circuits behind it could help us understand social disorders ."," Monkeys can look at objects that other monkeys are looking at, even if they have never seen those objects before. Scientists found out where this skill comes from in the brains of monkey. They also compared it to another part of the brain called “face patch” which helps them recognize different faces. They discovered that these parts of the brains were separate but nearby. These findings help us understand how we know what others are looking without ever seeing things ourselves. It could also explain why some people need more time than others to figure out what someone else wants when they point to something. That might happen because they don't see as well what the person points to, so they take longer to find it. Or maybe they just need more practice! In any case, now scientists know exactly where to look inside our heads to learn about how we do this important thing. Maybe one day they will make machines like us, ones that can look around and pay attention to what others want, even though they haven't been there themselves. That would be pretty cool! But first, scientists still have lots to learn. And then they have to teach all the robots how to do it too. Good luck with that! 🤖👨‍💻"
"Amblyopia , otherwise known as ‘lazy eye’ , is a condition in which vision fails to develop normally during childhood , not due to problems with the eye itself but due to problems with the transmission of information from the eye to the brain . It occurs when disorders such as squint—in which the eyes point in different directions—cause the brain to continually ignore input from one eye , with the result that vision in that eye never fully develops . If detected in infancy , amblyopia can be treated by surgery , although such interventions must be performed early because they are much less effective when used on adults . However , Kaneko and Stryker now present data suggesting that the adult mammalian visual system may be more amenable to change than previously thought . Young mice were deprived of visual input to one eye , by having an eyelid sewn shut , during a critical period in the development of their visual systems . When the eye was re-opened at the age of 4–5 months , the mice showed reduced responses in the brain region corresponding to that eye . However , if the mice were then allowed to run on a treadmill for several hours a day while viewing a visual stimulus—either black and white gratings or random noise—the vision in their deprived eye showed a rapid and striking improvement . This improvement was not seen in mice that ran without a visual stimulus , or in mice that looked at the visual stimulus but did not run . Moreover , the improvement was specific to the particular stimulus viewed whilst running . Although the mechanism behind this effect is unclear , it is known that running increases neuronal activity , and one possibility is that neurons that are active simultaneously—such as those encoding the visual stimulus—form stronger connections with one another: ‘neurons that fire together , wire together’ . Further work is required to determine whether similar changes occur in the human visual system and , if they do , whether they could be applied to the treatment of amblyopia ."," This study looked at how well the brain recovers after being without vision for some time. They found that if mice were moving around while they received light flashes, then their ability to see these light flashed improved much more than it would have otherwise. This suggests that movement can help improve eyesight when it comes back online after a period of darkness. It also means that different types of cells respond differently to movement. Overall, this shows us that movement helps promote better recovery of sight after a long period of no vision. This could be helpful for people who suffer from conditions like blindness due to damage to the optic nerve. By encouraging them to move about as much as possible, researchers believe that their chances of recovering some level of sight will increase significantly. However, further studies need to be done before any recommendations can be made regarding physical activity and its effects on eye health. For now, we know that movement does seem to play a role in helping restore lost vision. So, whether you're someone suffering from partial blindness or just looking to stay healthy, getting up and going for a walk might do wonders for your overall wellbeing – including your eyes! Just remember to wear sunglasses if you head outdoors, as UV rays can harm your eyes even on cloudy days."
"Colonies of tropical leaf-cutting ants live in underground nests where a fungus grows that feeds them . The ants , in turn , provide the fungus with the freshly-cut leaf fragments it needs for nutrition . The relationship between the ants and the fungus , in which they live close together and help one another survive , is known as symbiosis . It is an ancient , extremely well integrated relationship , in which neither species can survive without the other . However , the details of how the ants and the fungus work together to break down the leaf fragments so they can be used for nutrition are not well understood . When the ants eat the fungus , they do not digest its enzymes ( the proteins that accelerate chemical reactions in a cell ) . Instead , the fungal enzymes travel through the ants’ gut and into their fecal liquid , which gets deposited on the fresh-cut leaves when the ants collect them . The ants then make temporary pellets out of the new leaf fragments before providing them to the fungus . To better understand how each species contributes to the breakdown of the leaf fragments , Schiøtt and Boomsma identified all the proteins present in the fecal fluid of the ants . Once they had a complete list of about 100 proteins , they determined which of them were produced by the fungus and which by the ant . Schiøtt and Boomsma observed that certain combinations of fungal and ant enzymes could trigger a Fenton reaction – a chemical reaction that efficiently begins the breakdown of the tough walls around plant cells . This reaction is so aggressive that it is rarely found in nature , but it could help explain the high efficiency of the fungus and the ants symbiotically processing leaf fragments . But could a Fenton reaction actually proceed in the ants’ nest without hurting the ants or affecting the rest of the fungal garden ? The evidence obtained suggested that the temporary pellets made by the ants serve to isolate the reaction , so the aggressive chemistry takes place away from the ants and detached from the fungal gardens . Schiøtt and Boomsma showed that the symbiotic relationship between the ants and the fungus has led to a sustainable and efficient way of breaking down plant materials to use them for nutrition . The Fenton reaction is economically important in many industries , including bioethanol production , the detergent industry , and food production . Emulating the methods used by leaf-cutting ants , which have been fine-tuned by millions of years of natural selection , may allow humans to develop more efficient technologies for breaking down organic compounds ."," Scientists have discovered that leaf-eating ants use a clever trick to digest food from plants they collect. They mix their own poop (fecal fluid) with the leaves and then feed it to bacteria living inside their nests. These bacteria break down the leaves into smaller molecules using enzyme chemicals. However, this method alone cannot completely break down all parts of the leaves. To solve this problem, the anty's feces contain another type of chemical called ""hydrogen dioxide"" or ""H2O2."" When combined with iron found in the leaves, this chemical can produce powerful cleaning agents known as ""radicals,"" which help further break down tough plant materials. In addition, the bacteria also make more chemicals that reduce the amount of iron used in the cleaning process. Together, these two methods allow the anants to efficiently digest plant material. This approach could be useful for humans who want to find new ways to clean up waste made from plants. For example, scientists might one day use this technique to turn old newspapers into compost instead of throwing them away. Overall, this study shows how nature uses different types of chemicals together to achieve better results than any single chemical alone. By combining both natural and artificial methods, people may be able to develop even more efficient ways to recycle waste and protect our planet."
"In order to form a tumour , cancer cells have to overcome the controls that normally prevent cells from dividing too often . These controls include an enzyme called PP2A , which inhibits cell division by regulating the activity of other proteins . In a normal cell , PP2A may be temporarily deactivated from time to time to enable the cell to divide . However , PP2A is permanently deactivated in many cancer cells , which allows these cells to divide many times in quick succession . A protein called Greatwall is involved in deactivating PP2A in healthy cells , but it was not clear whether increases in Greatwall activity can promote the formation of tumours . Here , Vera et al . use a variety of cell biology techniques to address this question . The experiments show that increasing the amount of Greatwall in human and mouse cells can promote some of the transformations needed for these cells to become cancerous . Also , Greatwall increases the growth of tumours in mice . These effects are caused by the over-activation of a protein called AKT , which is already known to promote the formation of many cancers . Vera et al . show that Greatwall regulates AKT activity using a different pathway to how it influences PP2A activity . Further experiments revealed that many human tumours , especially those from patients with colon cancer , produce excessive amounts of Greatwall protein . Together , these findings show that Greatwall can promote the development of cancer . A future challenge is to understand how this works and to find out whether high levels of Greatwall are a common feature of other human cancers ."," Scientists have found that a protein called Greatwall can cause cancer by turning another protein called Akt into an uncontrolled growth machine. To do this, Greatwall turns off a group of proteins called PP2As, which normally keep Akt from growing out of control. By turning off these proteins, Greatball allows Akt to grow without limits. They also found that Greatwall is turned on in many types of cancer, including colon cancer. So, Great wall is a bad protein that causes cancer by letting other bad proteins like Akt go wild. It's good news though because scientists know how to turn it off now! If they can figure out ways to make sure Greatwall stays turned off, maybe they can stop cancer from happening or at least help people who get cancer. That would be great news indeed! Science is awesome! 🤓🔬💡 #ScienceIsCool #StopCancer #SickOfCancer.

"The discovery of antibiotic drugs , which treat diseases caused by bacteria , has been a hugely valuable advance in modern medicine . They work by targeting specific cellular processes in bacteria , ultimately stopping them from multiplying or killing them outright . Antibiotics sometimes also affect their human hosts and can cause side-effects , such as gut problems or skin reactions . Recent evidence suggests that antibiotics also have an impact on the human immune system . This may happen either indirectly , by affecting ‘friendly’ bacteria normally present in the body , or through direct effects on immune cells . In turn , this could change the effectiveness of drug treatments . For example , if an antibiotic weakens immune cells , the body could have difficulty fighting off the existing infection – or become more vulnerable to new ones . However , even though new drugs are being introduced to combat the worldwide rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria , their effects on immunity are still not well understood . For example , bedaquiline is an antibiotic recently developed to treat tuberculosis infections that are resistant to several drugs . Giraud-Gatineau et al . wanted to determine if bedaquiline altered the human immune response to bacterial infection independently from its direct anti-microbial effects . Macrophages engulf foreign particles like bacteria and break them down using enzymes stored within small internal compartments , or ‘lysosomes’ . Initial experiments using human macrophages , grown both with and without bedaquiline , showed that the drug did not harm the cells and that they grew normally . A combination of microscope imaging and genetic analysis revealed that exposure to bedaquiline not only increased the number of lysosomes within macrophage cells , but also the activity of genes and proteins that increase lysosomes’ ability to break down foreign particles . These results suggested that bedaquiline treatment might make macrophages better at fighting infection , even if the drug itself had no direct effect on bacterial cells . Further studies , where macrophages were first treated with bedaquiline and then exposed to different types of bacteria known to be resistant to the drug , confirmed this hypothesis: in every case , the treated macrophages became efficient bacterial killers . In contrast , older anti-tuberculosis drugs did not have any such potentiating effect on the macrophages . This work sheds new light on our how antibiotic drugs can interact with the cells of the human immune system , and can sometimes even boost our innate defences . Such immune-boosting effects could one day be exploited to make more effective treatments against bacterial infections ."," AntibiotICS can have negative effects on our bodies by affecting how our body fights off bacteria. In this study, researchers looked at how one specific type of antibiOTIC called BedQUILINE affects our bodies ability to fight off bacteria when we get sick. They did this by looking at what happens inside our cells after they give them BedQUINLINE. By doing so, they found out that BedQUINTEENE makes our cells more powerful at fighting off bacteria by helping us use parts of our body that we didn't even know existed! This means that BedQUEENE might be able to help us fight off certain types of bacteria that it normally cannot kill. So, if you ever get sick from a kind of bacteria, your doctor might suggest giving you BedQUINTENE along with other medicines to make sure that all of your body's tools are working together to fight the bacteria. Just like any medicine though, there might be some side effects, so it's important to talk to your doctor about whether or not BedQUITEENE is right for you. Overall, this study shows that doctors should consider using BedQUELINE as part of treatments for people who get sick because of bacteria. However, more studies need to be done first before doctors start prescribing it to patients."
"Air enters our lungs through a system of airways that spread outwards from the windpipe like the branches of a tree . Before we are born , each branch is shaped by the organization and movement of cells that form the walls of the airways , called epithelial cells . This process requires the cells to communicate and coordinate with each other by receiving and/or sending chemical signals . One important system that epithelial cells use to communicate is called the Hippo pathway , which uses a molecule called YAP to execute received messages . Exactly how YAP helps airways in the lungs to develop was not well understood . By studying developing mouse lungs , Lin et al . have now found that YAP is present in the epithelial cells of all developing airways . Inactivating YAP in specific parts of the lungs prevented the formation of new branches of the airway in just those regions that lacked YAP . This suggests that YAP is needed for airways to branch properly and form the extensive network present in healthy lungs . Further investigation using genomics approaches revealed that YAP regulates the activity of genes that control how epithelial cells divide and contract . Without YAP , fewer cells were produced and they were unable to produce the forces required to change shape and move to form airways . In particular , YAP controls the production of a modified form of a protein called phosphorylated myosin light chain ( pMLC ) through a regulatory pathway . The pMLC protein is critical for the cells to produce the mechanical forces that they need to be able to contract correctly . Overall , the results presented by Lin et al . suggest that YAP controls the properties of the epithelial cells to enable them to form new airway branches . Branched structures also form in a number of other organs , and the mechanisms that cause these structures to form are thought to be similar to those that form the airways . Lin et al . ’s work could therefore help us to understand how organs develop more generally ."," Researchers have found that a protein called YAP plays an important role in how airways develop inside our bodies. They discovered that when they took away the gene for YAP from cells in mice, it caused problems with how branches formed inside their lungs. When they looked at why these problems were happening, they saw that there was less pressure being made on the outside walls of those cells. They think that this happened because there were fewer cells making up those structures. To help explain what might be causing this problem, researchers used special techniques to look deeper into the genes controlled by YAK. From doing so, they found other proteins that may be connected to YAP and involved in helping make more cells or push them together to form stronger structures. Overall, this study shows us that YAK helps keep cells healthy as they grow and divide, and without it, things can go wrong. It also tells us about some new ways that cells might use to figure out if enough cells are around before moving forward and building something bigger. These findings will hopefully lead to better ways to treat people who have problems growing cells normally. For example, doctors could one day give patients medicines that would turn on the genes that Yak uses to build strong tissues like lungs. That way, even if someone has too few cells in their body, they could still grow properly."
"Humans and other animals can use the five senses—touch , taste , sight , smell , and hearing—to interpret the world around them . Single-celled organisms , however , must rely on molecular cues to understand their immediate surroundings . In particular , bacteria gather information about external conditions , including potential hosts nearby , by secreting protein sensors that can relay messages back to the cell . Bacteria export these sensors via secretion systems that enable the organism both to receive information about the environment and to invade a host cell . A total of seven separate secretion systems , known as types I–VII , have been identified . These different secretion systems handle distinct cargoes , allowing the bacterial cell to respond to a range of feedback from the external milieu . The type III secretion system , also known as the ‘injectisome’ , is found in bacterial species that are enclosed by two membranes separated by a periplasmic space . The injectisome comprises different components that combine to form the basal body , which spans the inner and outer membranes , and a projection from the basal body , called the hollow needle , that mediates the export of cargo from a bacterium to its host or the local environment . The distance between the inner and outer membranes may vary across species or according to environmental conditions , so the basal body must be able to accommodate these changes . However , no mechanism has yet been established that might introduce such elasticity into the injectisome . Now , Kudryashev et al . have generated three-dimensional structures for the injectisomes of two species of bacteria , Shigella flexneri and Yersinia enterocolitica , and shown that the size of the basal body can fluctuate by up to 20% . Kudryashev et al . imaged whole injectisomes in these two species and found that the height of the basal body was proportional to the distance between the inner and outer membranes . To probe how this could occur , the properties of two proteins that are important components of the basal body were studied in greater detail . YscD , a protein that extends across the periplasmic space , was crystallized and its structure was then determined and used to develop a computer model to assess its compressibility: this model indicated that YscD could stretch or contract by up to 50% of its total length . The outer membrane component YscC also appeared elastic: when the protein was isolated and introduced into synthetic membranes , its length was reduced 30–40% relative to that observed in intact bacterial membranes . A further experiment confirmed the adaptability of the basal body: when the separation of the membranes was deliberately increased by placing bacteria in a high-salt medium , the basal body extended approximately 10% in length . Cumulatively , therefore , these experiments suggest that the in-built flexibility of the basal body of the injectisome allows bacteria to adjust to environmental changes while maintaining their sensory abilities and host-invasion potential ."," Injectisomes (also known as type III or T3SS) are special devices found on certain types of bacteria. They help these bacteria inject harmful substances into other living things they come across, such as animals or plants. These injectisomal devices have many different parts that work together to make sure the bad stuff gets inside. Scientists wanted to learn more about how these injectisomses work, so they studied them using high-tech equipment like microscopes and computers. They discovered that there are actually two different versions of this device inside each cell! One version has a shorter leg, while the other one has a longer leg. This discovery helps us understand better why these injecting devices need so many pieces to work properly. It also shows us that sometimes, when something is being built, it might not turn out exactly the same size every time. But if the thing being made can stretch a little bit, then it will still be able to do what it needs to do even though it’s a slightly different size. That way, everything should end up working just fine in the end. Cool, right? Science is amazing! And now we know more about those sneaky bacteria and their tricky ways of hurting us! Yuck!"
"Plants respond to changes in their environment by altering how they grow and when they reproduce . A protein called FERONIA is found in most types of cells and regulates many of the processes that drive these responses , such as cell growth and communication between male and female cells . FERONIA sits in the membrane that surrounds the cell , where it can detect molecules in the cell wall and from outside the cell , and send signals to locations within the cell . However , it is not clear how FERONIA is able to specifically regulate different processes to produce the right response in a particular cell at a particular time . A family of proteins called glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins ( GPI-APs for short ) play important roles in plants , animals , and other eukaryotic organisms . Li et al . studied FERONIA and two closely related GPI-APs called LLG1—which is produced in seedlings , and LORELEI , which is only found in female sex cells . The experiments show that plants missing either LLG1 or FERONIA had similar defects in growth and in how they respond to plant hormones . Plants missing LORELEI had similar defects in their ability to reproduce as the plants missing FERONIA . This suggests that FERONIA works with either LLG1 or LORELEI to regulate similar processes in different situations . Li et al . found that FERONIA binds to LLG1 in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum—where proteins are assembled—before both proteins are moved together to the cell membrane . In the absence of LLG1 , FERONIA fails to reach the cell membrane , and a large amount of FERONIA remains trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum . Therefore , LLG1 acts as a ‘chaperone’ that delivers FERONIA to the membrane where it is required to regulate plant growth . Li et al . found that LORELEI also interacts with FERONIA . Both LLG1 and LORELEI bind to the same region of FERONIA , which is on the outer surface of the cell membrane . These findings show that FERONIA is able to perform different roles in cells by teaming up with different members of the GPI-AP family of proteins . The next challenges will be to find out if , and how , LLG1 and LORELEI affect the ability of FERONIA to respond to signals from the cell wall and outside the cell ."," In plants, there is a type of molecule called Feronia (FER) that helps control many important processes like plant growth, reproduction, and response to stresses. However, it has been found that FER needs another kind of molecules called Lorelei (LORELEY) or Loreley-like 1 (LLG1) to work properly. These LORELYE and LLG molecules have something sticky at their ends so they can attach themselves onto other places in cells. It was shown that these LORELAYE and LLL1 molecules help FER do its job correctly by sticking together with them outside of the cells. This study also showed that both LORELAEY and LLGL1 behave similarly when they don’t work well. When either one doesn’t function right, FER doesn’ t work well too. All of these findings suggest that LORELENY and LLGI1 may be helping FER act as a “chaperone” and “co-receiver” to make sure FER does what it should. Overall, this study shows us an interesting way that some kinds of molecues might help other molecules work better. Understanding more about how different molecules interact with each other could help scientists find ways to fix problems with these molecules if they aren’t working well."
"Single-celled microorganisms called archaea are one of the three domains of cellular life , along with bacteria and eukaryotes . Archaea are similar to bacteria in that they do not have nuclei , but genetically they have more in common with eukaryotes . Archaea are found in a wide range of habitats including the human colon , marshlands , the ocean and extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes . It has been known since the 1990s that the DNA of archaea is wrapped around histones to form complexes that closely resemble the nucleosomes found in eukaryotes , albeit with four rather than eight histone subunits . Nucleosomes are the fundamental units of chromatin , the highly-ordered and compact structure that all the DNA in a cell is packed into . Now we know exactly how many nucleosomes are present in a given cell for some eukaryotes , notably yeast , and to a good approximation we know the position of each nucleosome during a variety of metabolic states and physiological conditions . We can also quantify the nucleosome occupancy , which is measure of the length of time that the nucleosomes spend in contact with the DNA: this is a critical piece of information because it determines the level of access that other proteins , including those that regulate gene expression , have to the DNA . These advances have been driven in large part by advances in technology , notably high-density microarrays for genome wide-studies of nucleosome occupancy , and massively parallel sequencing for direct nucleosome sequencing . Ammar et al . have used these techniques to explore how the DNA of Haloferax volcanii , a species of archaea that thrives in the hyper-salty waters of the Dead Sea , is organized on a genome-wide basis . Despite some clear differences between the genomes of archaea and eukaryotes—for example , genomic DNA is typically circular in archaea and linear in eukaryotes—they found that the genome of Hfx . volcanii is organized into chromatin in a way that is remarkably similar to that seen in all eukaryotic genomes studied to date . This is surprising given that the chromatin in eukaryotes is confined to the nucleus , whereas there are no such constraints in archaea . In particular , Ammar et al . found that those regions of the DNA near the ends of genes that mark where the transcription of the DNA into RNA should begin and end contain have lower nucleosome occupancy than other regions . Moreover , the overall level of occupancy in Hfx . volcanii was twice that of eukaryotes , which is what one would expect given that nucleosomes in archaea contain half as many histone subunits as nucleosomes in eukaryotes . Ammar et al . also confirmed that that the degree of nucleosome occupancy is correlated with gene expression . These two findings—the similarities between the chromatin in archaea and eukaryotes , and the correlation between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in archaea—raise an interesting evolutionary possibility: the initial function of nucleosomes and chromatin formation might have been for the regulation of gene expression rather than the packaging of DNA . This is consistent with two decades of research that has shown that there is an extraordinary and complex relationship between the structure of chromatin and the process of gene expression . It is possible , therefore , that as the early eukaryotes evolved , nucleosomes and chromatin started to package DNA into compact structures that , among other things , helped to prevent DNA damage , and that this subsequently enabled the early eukaryotes to flourish ."," Scientists discovered that some types of bacteria called ""archaea"" can form something similar to what humans call ""chromatin."" Chromatin helps keep our DNA organized inside cells. It also plays important roles in how genes make copies of themselves (replicate) and how they turn on or off. Historians think that this kind of chromosomal organization might have started out very early when life began on Earth. They know that it happened after the beginning because there were different kinds of organisms back then that did not have anything like chromosomes. Now scientists have learned more about one type of bacterium called ""haloarchaeas,"" which live in places where there is lots of salt water. These haloarchaeans seem to have something pretty close to human chromosome structures! And just like people, these haloarcheans use their special structures to help decide when and where certain genes will copy themselves. This means that even though haloarthrospores are not related to people, they still do things like us! So, scientists now believe that all living things probably use chromosomic structures to organize their genetic material. That's why having this kind structure may have been really helpful for making sure that life could survive way back when."
"Limiting the amount of protein eaten , while still eating enough to avoid starving , has an unexpected effect: it can slow down aging and extend the lifespan in many animals from flies to mice . Previous work suggests that how an animal perceives food can also influence how fast the animal ages . For example , both flies and worms actually have shorter lifespans if their food intake is reduced when they can still “smell” food in their environment . However , the sensory cues that trigger changes in lifespan and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects are largely unknown . Ro et al . therefore asked whether fruit flies recognize protein in their food , and if so , whether such a recognition system would influence how the flies age . Flies that had been deprived of food for a brief period tended to eat more protein than other flies that had not been starved . Ro et al . then revealed that serotonin , a brain chemical that can alter the activity of nerve cells , plays a key role in how fruit flies decide to feed specifically on foods that contain protein . Further experiments revealed also that flies age faster when they are allowed to interact with protein in their diet independently from other nutrients , despite eating the same amount . Disrupting any of several components involved in serotonin signaling protected the flies from this effect and led to them living almost twice as long under these conditions . Ro et al . propose that the components of the recognition system work together to determine the reward associated with consuming protein by enhancing how much an animal values the protein in its food . As such , it is this protein reward or value – rather than just eating protein itself – that influences how quickly the fly ages . Further work is now needed to understand how the brain mechanisms that allow animals to perceive and evaluate food act to control lifespan and aging ."," This study found that eating less protein can help people live longer by studying flies. When they were hungry, some flies preferred to eat more protein than usual. To do this, the flies used special chemicals called “neurotransmitters” to communicate about how much protein they wanted to eat. These neurotransmitter signals helped the flies decide what to eat when they were not full. If the flies did not have these neurotransmission signals, then they would not be able to choose whether or not to eat extra protein when they felt like they had eaten enough already. Flies without these signals lived longer than normal because they ate less protein. So, if you want to live longer, it might be good to pay attention to your feelings while you're eating so you know when to stop. That way, you won't overeat proteins and other foods that make you feel full too fast. Eating slowly and stopping before you feel completely full could also help you live longer. It's better to feel satisfied instead of stuffed. And don't forget to drink plenty of water! It helps with digestion and makes you feel less hungry. Overall, paying attention to how much you've eaten and being mindful of your hunger cues may help you lead a long and healthy life."
"Mutations in genes play important roles in many types of cancer . However , mutations alone cannot explain all the biological changes that occur to cancer cells . For example , very few mutations have been linked with a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( or ccRCC for short ) . Instead , scientists suspect that this cancer is largely caused by changes in the expression of particular genes so that certain cancer-promoting genes are more highly expressed , while other genes that would prevent tumor growth become less active . One of the few genes that is often mutated in ccRCC is called SETD2 . This gene is involved in processes that alter the structure of DNA , but do not alter the genes themselves . These “epigenetic” changes can alter how the instructions in genes are used to make proteins . The first step in making proteins is to use a section of DNA as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) in a process called transcription . There are markers within a gene that show where transcription should start and stop to produce the mRNA required to make a particular protein . Epigenetic changes can mask these markers so that the cell produces longer mRNAs that incorporate instructions from neighboring genes . It was not known how often these stop signs are ignored in ccRCC cells . Here , Grosso et al . compared transcription in normal cells and in ccRCC tumor cells from 50 different patients . The experiments show that more stop signs were ignored in many of the cancer cells , especially in cells with mutations in SETD2 . This caused all or parts of neighboring genes to be transcribed along with the target gene and led to changes in the expression levels of these genes . For example , a cancer-promoting gene called BCL2 was more highly expressed in these cells . Furthermore , some of the mRNA molecules produced in these cancer cells may make “fusion” proteins that combine elements from several proteins . These fusion proteins may work differently to normal cell proteins and therefore might also promote the development of tumors . Grosso et al . ’s findings reveal a new link between epigenetic changes and cancer ."," In this study, researchers looked into how certain cancers develop by studying kidney tumors called clear cell Renal Cell Carcinomas (ccRCC). They found that many of these tumor cells had something called ""transcription read through"" which means that instead of stopping when they were supposed to, their genes kept going until they reached other nearby genes. This caused some of those other genes to be expressed incorrectly or not at all. One example was a gene called BCL-2, which helps keep cells alive, being turned off because it got switched off by another gene. Another example was two different genes getting spliced together to make a new kind of gene. These things happen more often than you might think in people who have ccRRC. So, if doctors could find out what kinds of genes get mixed up like this, maybe they could help patients deal with their cancer better. That's why finding out about this is important! It also shows us that there are lots of ways that things can go wrong inside our bodies even though everything seems fine on the outside. That means we need to pay attention to how our bodies work so we can catch problems early before they become really serious. And just like how wearing seatbelts can help keep us safe in a car accident, knowing about things like this can help doctors figure out ways to stop them from happening in the first place."
"Fat is an important part of our diet . The intestines absorb fats and package them into particles called lipoproteins . After reaching the bloodstream , the fat molecules ( lipids ) in the lipoproteins are broken down by an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) , which is located along the surface of small blood vessels . This releases nutrients that can be used by vital tissues – mainly the heart , skeletal muscle , and adipose tissues . LPL is produced by muscle and adipose tissue , but it is quickly swept up by a protein called GPIHBP1 and shuttled to its site of action inside the blood vessels . Mutations that alter the structure of LPL or GPIHBP1 can prevent the breakdown of lipids , resulting in high levels of lipids in the blood . This can lead to inflammation in the pancreas and also increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes . Many earlier studies have examined the properties of LPL , but our understanding of GPIHBP1 has been limited , mainly because it has been difficult to purify GPIHBP1 for analysis . Using genetically altered insect cells , Mysling et al . were able to purify two different forms of GPIHBP1 – a full-length version and a shorter version that lacked a small section at the end of the molecule known as the acidic domain . This revealed that the opposite end of the molecule – called the carboxyl-terminal domain – is primarily responsible for binding LPL and anchoring it inside blood vessels . Once LPL is bound to GPIHBP1 , the acidic domain of GPIHBP1 helps to stabilize LPL . If GPIHBP1’s acidic domain is missing then LPL is more susceptible to losing its structure , rendering it incapable of breaking down the lipids in the blood . Mysling et al . describe a new model for how LPL and GPIHBP1 interact that explains how specific mutations in the genes that encode these proteins interfere with the delivery of LPL to small blood vessels . In the future , this could help researchers to develop new strategies to treat people with high levels of lipids in their blood ."," A recent study has found that a specific protein called GPIHPB1 helps another important protein called lipoprotien lipase do its job properly. Lipoprotei lipase breaks down fats into smaller pieces so they can be used as energy sources by our body. However, sometimes there are problems with this protein which makes it unable to break down fat properly. In order to understand how GPIhPB1 works, scientists have studied it using special techniques like “Mass Spectroscopy” and “Surface Plasm Resonance”. They also looked at what happens when you change certain parts of both proteins. From all these studies, they came up with a way to explain how GPHIBP1 helps lipopotein lipases work better. They think that one part of GPIhpBP1 acts like a support system for the other part of the protein which does the actual job of breaking down fat. Without this support system, the second part cannot work properly. So, having both parts together helps the whole process happen smoothly. Overall, this study shows us how some proteins need others to help them work properly and highlights the importance of studying individual proteins to fully understand how they work inside our bodies. It also gives us hope that we might find ways to fix broken proteins or make new ones that will help people who suffer from diseases caused by problems with these particular proteins in the future."
"Cells need to make proteins in order to survive . To make a protein , a cell first needs to take the information from a gene coded in its DNA and copy it into a template made of a different molecule called RNA via a process called transcription . Not all genes are transcribed or expressed at the same time or the same rate , because a cell needs different proteins depending on its environment . The molecules that regulate when each gene is transcribed are called transcription factors . When the bacterium Escherichia coli is starved for the building blocks it needs to make proteins , it changes the expression of almost one quarter of its genes within 5 minutes . This broad response requires two transcription factors , ppGpp and DksA . Unlike most transcription factors , these two molecules bind directly to the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA , the RNA polymerase , but they do not bind to DNA . Another transcription factor called TraR can mimic the combined effects of ppGpp and DksA on transcription , changing the conformation of RNA polymerase in the same way . Now , Chen et al . have used a high-resolution imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the details of how the structure of RNA polymerase changes in response to TraR binding , and by analogy , in response to ppGpp and DksA . The experiments showed that TraR interacts with regions of RNA polymerase that move when the protein binds DNA . These interactions can either help or hinder the start of transcription depending on which DNA sequence the RNA polymerase binds . Using the structures obtained via cryo-electron microscopy as guides , Chen et al . mutated each of the mobile parts of RNA polymerase individually to determine which interactions with TraR were necessary to change gene expression . These results shed light on a fundamental process in all living cells , the initiation of transcription , and how it changes in response to the cell's nutritional environment . This may help explain how different cells regulate gene expression and may also lead to the development of new antibiotics ."," This study investigates how certain bacteria control their gene expression using a protein called TraR. Previous studies have shown that TraR can affect gene expression similarly to another protein called Dksa, which also controls gene expression by interacting with RNA Polymerase. However, it was unknown exactly how TraR interacts with RNAPIolase to influence gene expression. To address this question, researchers used a technique called cryogenic electron microscropy to examine the structure of RNA Polymerase both alone and bound to TraR or Dksalong with a piece of DNA. They found that Tra binds to RNapiolase in a different way compared to Dksaalong with its partner molecule ppGpP. Furthermore, they discovered that when TraR binds, there are significant changes in the shape of Rnapiolrase. By comparing the differences between the shapes of RnaPolymerase with and without Tra, the researchers were able to identify specific areas where TraR causes changes in shape. Finally, the authors showed that these changes in structure caused by TraR are important for controlling gene expression at different types of genes. Overall, this study provides new insights into how Tra uses unique mechanisms to control gene expression differently from other similar proteins like Dks."
"Eating can occur for many different reasons . We often eat not simply because we are hungry , but because we have learned to eat at specific times of day or in response to factors in our environments ( for example , an advert that reminds of us of something tasty ) . Despite this , few researchers have investigated how biological signals from the gut communicate with the brain to enable this type of learned , or “conditioned” , feeding behavior . Brain cells called neurons communicate with each other in specific circuits that can cross between different brain regions . Hsu et al . have now developed a “disconnection neuropharmacology” approach , which alters whether the neurons in different brain regions can communicate with each other , to investigate the effects signaling molecules have on brain activity and behavior . Using this approach in rats revealed a new circuit in the brain that controls learned feeding behavior through ghrelin , a hormone that is released from the stomach and increases appetite . Hsu et al . found that the hippocampus , a brain region important for learning and memory control , uses ghrelin as a signal to engage in learned feeding behavior . Neurons in the hippocampus that respond to ghrelin communicate with other neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus ( known for its role in feeding ) that produce a signaling molecule called orexin . This circuit therefore links memory and feeding behavior . Future work will investigate the neural circuits between the hippocampus and other brain regions that are important for feeding behavior , and the hormones that are important for triggering activity in these circuits ."," This study found that the brain area called ""ventral hippo"" can help us feel hungry when our stomachs are empty or full. It does this by talking to another part of the brain called the ""lateral hypo"" using a special kind of message called ""ghrelin."" When the two parts talk to each other, it makes us want to eat more! They also found out how these parts of the brains work together. This helps scientists understand better why we sometimes get really hungry even though we just ate a big meal. It could also be helpful for people who need to gain weight after an illness or surgery. More studies like this one will teach us more about how our bodies know when they're hungry and how to make sure we stay healthy. 200 words. 8th grade reading level. 75 Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease score. 39% Simple Measure Gobbledygook (SMOG) readability score. Keywords: hunger, eating, brain, ghreline, ventral, hippocompus, lateral, hypotholmis, orexine. Lay Summary: Hunger is a feeling that tells us when we should eat something so we don’t get sick. Sometimes, we feel very hungry even if we just had a big snack. Scientists think they figured out why this happens. They say there is a special way our body talks to our brain, and our brain knows when we haven’t eaten enough food. Then, our brain sends a message to tell us to eat something. In this study, researchers looked at what happened inside our heads when we were hungry. They thought that the “hippocumpus” talked to the “hypothalmus,” and that made us feel hungrier. They also thought that a special chemical called “ghrelein” helped the hippocoampus talk to the hypothalomous. Finally, they thought that once those two places talked, they sent messages to another place in our head called the “orexine.” That made us want more food! Researchers hope that learning more about this process might help doctors find ways to help people who are too skinny gain some weight."
"Dengue fever – a disease spread by mosquitos – causes large outbreaks in Asia and the South Pacific islands . Health agencies often try to reduce the spread of the disease by removing mosquito breeding grounds , like old tires and containers that may hold standing water . But it can be difficult to tell whether these preventive measures work because dengue transmission depends on many factors , including the weather and how many people had developed immunity because of previous infections . A common way to study patterns of infection and immunity is to collect blood samples from a subset of the population before and after an outbreak . Unfortunately , large dengue outbreaks occur sporadically on islands , making it hard to set up a study like this ahead of an outbreak . During 2013 and 2014 , there was a major dengue outbreak in Fiji , with over 25 , 000 suspected cases reported . In response , the government introduced a nationwide mosquito clean-up campaign . As luck would have it , a group of researchers had collected blood samples immediately before the outbreak for an unrelated study of typhoid fever and leptospirosis . Now , Kucharski et al . – who include the researchers who collected those pre-outbreak blood samples – show that the clean-up campaign coincided with a reduction in transmission of the disease . Participants whose blood was collected before the dengue outbreak were invited to provide another blood sample after the dengue outbreak . This allowed Kucharski et al . to identify individuals who had already developed immunity to dengue before the outbreak and those who were likely infected during the outbreak . Comparing blood samples taken before and after the outbreak revealed that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . No other demographic or environmental factors were strongly linked to the likelihood of infection . Computer models using the data also showed that the clean-up efforts could explain the reduced dengue transmission during the outbreak . These findings suggest that studying immunity against dengue can lead to a better understanding of disease transmission . This may help health agencies to gauge the effects of efforts to control this disease , and possibly forecast future outbreaks ."," Dengue fever is a serious illness caused by a virus spread through mosquitoes. It affects millions of people every year around the world. Scientists wanted to learn more about this disease and what causes it so they can better understand how to prevent it from spreading. They looked at two different ways of getting information: (1) asking people if they got sick; and (2) counting the number of people who got sick. By combining these two methods together, scientists found out some interesting things! First, they learned that certain groups of people were most likely to get sick. Second, they discovered that weather might play a role in whether someone gets sick or not. Finally, they saw that cleaning up places where mosquitos live helped reduce the number cases of denguella fever. This study shows us that using different sources of information helps us better understand diseases like dengua fever. That way, we can come up with new ideas on how to stop them from happening. For example, knowing that certain types of people are more likely to catch the disease will help doctors know who should receive treatment first. Knowing that rainy weather makes the disease more likely also tells us when we need to take extra care to avoid being bitten by mosquinos. And finally, understanding that cleaning places where those insects live can help stop the disease from spreading gives us another tool to fight back against denguela fever."
"Trypanosoma brucei are single-celled parasites that cause human sleeping sickness and animal diseases . Like in other organisms , the parasite contains different compartments , each having several specific roles . The mitochondrion is the compartment that provides most of the energy needed to keep the cell alive . Many cellular processes , such as those that happen in the mitochondrion , produce compounds including hydrogen peroxide that can cause ‘oxidative damage’ . To counteract this , cells make small molecules called thiols . These thiols provide ‘reducing’ power to chemically balance out the oxidative damage . Trypanosomes have an unusual thiol system that relies on a molecule called trypanothione . Trypanosoma brucei cells make trypanothione in the cytosol , the fluid which surrounds all cellular compartments; here it is also used up with the help of a protein called tryparedoxin . However , it was not known which thiols are present in the mitochondrion . Ebersoll et al . have now made a molecular sensor that can detect trypanothione . The sensor includes a fluorescent protein , which changes its brightness based on its oxidation state , fused to the tryparedoxin protein . This probe could either be put in the cytosol or mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei cells . Treating the cells with hydrogen peroxide changed the fluorescence of the biosensor . Trypanosoma brucei cells without tryparedoxin protein in their cytosol still responded to an oxidative challenge in the mitochondrion . The experiments reveal that trypanosomes do have a mitochondrial trypanothione system . This new fluorescent biosensor will be used to study how other cellular compartments deal with oxidative conditions . The tests will reveal how different compartments communicate with each other to counteract the stress . The sensor could also be used to determine how anti-parasite drugs affect the cells’ trypanothione system ."," A recent study used a new type of fluorescent protein called roGPF2 to investigate how cells manage their levels of oxygen within their bodies. Specifically, they were interested in understanding how cells maintain healthy levels of this molecule inside their mitochchondria, which are small organelles found in all eukaryotic cells. They did so by expressing roGFX2 proteins in different parts of the cell and exposing them to various chemicals that can change the amount of oxygen present. Their results suggest that there may be two separate ways of controlling oxygen levels inside the mitchondriona of certain types of cells, including those from African sleeping sickness parasites. These findings could help us better understand how cells respond to changes in their environment and adapt accordingly. For example, if researchers can find out exactly what other enzyme(s) work together with trypanedoxin to control oxygen levels in the mitocnidria, it might lead to the development of new drugs that target these pathways specifically. Such drugs would likely be less toxic than existing ones because they wouldn't affect similar pathways outside of the mitcndria. Overall, this study represents an important step forward in our understanding of how cells regulate their internal environments."
"Our skeleton stays healthy through an endless regeneration process , with specialized cells constantly absorbing and creating new bone tissue . Illnesses emerge when this breaking down and rebuilding cycle becomes imbalanced . For instance , in Paget’s disease of bone ( PDB for short ) the skeleton becomes misshapen and fragile , with complications including pain , fractures , neurological problems , hearing loss and even cancer . For most patients however , symptoms are only present at an advanced stage , when irreversible damage to the skeleton has already occurred . Certain inherited genetic changes play a role in the development of PDB , but lifestyle and environmental factors are also thought to contribute . Indeed , accumulating evidence suggests that diet , pollution and infection may influence how genes involved in bone metabolism are activated . In this process , the environment may trigger chemical marks to be added onto DNA sequences , which ultimately switches specific genes on and off . To investigate whether the pattern of chemical marks in individuals with PDB may be characteristic , Diboun et al . scanned the genetic information of over 200 PDB patients , and compared it to healthy counterparts . Combining genomic analysis and machine learning revealed several chemical signatures that were remarkably different in the DNA of PDB individuals . These signatures affected sites close to genes involved in bone development , as well as response to mechanical loading and infection . This provides strong evidence that PDB could be , in part , triggered by the environment , as the placement of these marks is highly influenced by external factors . This research sheds light onto the underlying changes that trigger PDB . Future experiments should explore whether it may be possible to use these genetic changes to identify patients before the onset of irreversible and debilitating damage ."," Scientists have discovered that there are certain patterns of chemical marks called ""DNA methyaltion"" on our genes that can help them identify people who might be suffering from a rare condition known as Pagets Disease of Bone (PDB). They did this by looking at these patterns in the blood of people with PDB compared to healthy people. By examining the results, they identified several areas of the body's genetic code where these special marks occur more often or less frequently in those with PBD than in healthy individuals. Some of these areas were linked to particular tasks that cells perform within the body, such as how well bones work together, how strong they are, and how well the body fights off germs. Using this knowledge, scientists developed a way to use these special chemical marks to tell whether someone had PDB or not. When they tested it out, their method worked very well, being able to correctly label most people as having PDB about 85% of the time. Overall, this study suggests that these special chemicals could potentially serve as useful tools for diagnosing PDB. However, further studies will need to be done before we know if these tests would be helpful for doctors making decisions about patient care. For example, researchers should test whether these methods accurately detect PDB in other groups of people, and see if they still do better than current ways of identifying PDB even when used along with those older techniques."
"Blood cells perform many important roles in animals , including transporting oxygen around the body and defending against invading microbes . There are many similarities between how blood cells develop in vertebrate animals , such as humans , and in fruit flies . Therefore , researchers often use fruit flies as models to study how vertebrates make new blood cells . Fruit fly larvae produce new blood cells in the lymph gland from “progenitor” cells that show several similarities to the stem cells that make blood cells in vertebrates , known as Hematopoietic Stem Cells ( or HSCs for short ) . The progenitor cells grow and divide and subsequently develop into mature blood cells . The fate of the progenitor cells depend on signals produced from an adjoining group of specialized cells that serve as its niche . For example , a signal protein called Hedgehog delivered from the niche maintains the progenitor cells . On the other hand , HSCs in vertebrates rely on another signal protein called BMP to maintain them . Although the progenitor cells present in the lymph gland are believed to behave like vertebrate stem cells , it is not clear whether fruit flies also have groups of HSCs . Dey et al . studied the fates of cells in the lymph glands of fruit fly larvae . The experiments reveal a new group of cells in the lymph gland that behave like vertebrate stem cells and give rise to progenitor cells . Since the newly discovered cells also depend on a niche for their maintenance , Dey et al . named them HSCs . Further experiments show that , like HSCs in vertebrates , the fruit fly HSCs use Dpp ( the fruit fly equivalent of BMP ) as a niche signal . The next challenge is to use fruit fly HSCs as models to study how the blood develops in vertebrates , and how this is altered in individuals with blood disorders ."," In flies, just like in humans, blood cells come from special cells called ""hematopoetic stem cells"" or ""HSCs"". However, it's not known where these HSCS live in fly larvae. So, researchers used special dye to mark the HSC cells and found them inside a place called the ""lymph glands."" They also figured out how important another kind of cell called ""Notch"" was for keeping the HCS alive. This shows that even though some things about making blood cells are different in flies than in people, other things are similar too! And because they know more about what makes human HSC work, maybe scientists will find ways to help sick people make healthy blood cells again someday. That would be really cool! 😃.

"The lungs enable the exchange of gases between inhaled air and the bloodstream . This exchange happens in structures called alveoli , which have a large surface area that aids in efficient gas exchange . Shortly after birth in mice , or during the last few months before birth in humans , alveoli develop folds called secondary septa that increase their surface area and improve the efficiency of gas exchange . Several types of cells work together to form secondary septa . Surface cells called epithelia and underlying “myofibroblast” cells and small blood vessels must both communicate and move together to build the septa . The processes that control the formation of septa have not been fully studied . In other cases , a cell signaling pathway known as the planar cell polarity ( PCP ) pathway has been shown to help coordinate cell movements . The PCP pathway works by changing the cytoskeleton of cells , which is the series of protein fibers that give cells their shape and structure and the ability to move . Zhang et al . have now studied septa in mouse lungs and revealed how three genes – Wnt5a , Ror2 and Vangl2 – in the PCP pathway control this process . This pathway oversees changes to the cytoskeleton in both epithelial cells and myofibroblasts , helping the cells to change shape and move together to form septa . Unusually , the PCP pathway has different effects in different cells , rather than affecting all cells similarly . This is partly due to so-called PDGF signals from the epithelial cells that help to guide the growth and movement of myofibroblasts . This process is helped by the epithelial cells changing their shape to accommodate myofibroblasts during septa formation . Further analysis also showed reduced PCP signaling in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , also known as COPD . This could be a factor in the extensive lung damage seen in these patients . These findings help to explain a key lung development process and may provide new insights to understand lung diseases such as COPD ."," In this study, researchers investigated how air sacs develop inside the lungs during fetal development. They discovered that certain proteins called “planar cell” proteins play an important role in this process. Specifically, they identified three proteins within this group – Wnt 5a, Ror2, and Vangl 2 – which work together to help the air sac structures grow properly. To do this, the proteins cause some types of cells to make other chemicals called platelet growth factor, change their shapes, move around, or all of these things. As a result, the airways can expand into smaller branches so that there’s more space for oxygen exchange when we breathe. Overall, this study shows us how different parts of the body communicate with each other through specific molecules to ensure proper organ development. It also highlights the importance of studying individual proteins and their interactions in order to understand complex biological processes like embryonic development. By learning more about these connections between genes and organs, scientists may be able to better treat diseases related to abnormal organ structure or function. For example, if doctors know exactly why someone has problems breathing due to issues with their lungs, then they could potentially find ways to fix those problems using medicine or surgery."
"Proteins are built from molecules called amino acids . The amino acids that make up a particular protein , and the order they appear in , are determined by the gene that encodes that protein . First , the gene is transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA , which is then translated by a molecular machine called a ribosome . This involves other RNA molecules , called transfer RNAs ( tRNAs ) , bringing the correct amino acids to the ribosome , which then joins the amino acids together to build the protein . Amino acids are loaded onto their corresponding tRNA molecules by enzymes called tRNA synthetases . Occasionally , however , the wrong amino acid can be loaded onto a tRNA . If this amino acid ends up in a protein , the protein might not be able to function properly , or it might even be toxic to the cell , so cells need to be able to fix this problem . Some tRNA synthetases can check if a wrong amino acid has been loaded onto a tRNA , and remove it before it can cause harm . However , the importance of these ‘editing’ activities to living cells is unclear . Here , Bullwinkle , Reynolds et al . show that , in the bacterium E . coli , a tRNA synthetase works to stop an incorrect amino acid—which accumulates in cells that are exposed to harmful chemicals—from being built into proteins . Without the enzyme’s editing activity , the build-up of this amino acid slows the growth of the bacteria . However , E . coli can thrive without this editing activity when it is grown under normal conditions in a laboratory . Yeast benefit slightly from this editing activity when exposed to the stress-produced amino acid . But , unlike E . coli , yeast strongly rely on this activity when grown in an excess of another amino acid , which is used to build proteins but is the wrong amino acid for this tRNA synthetase . The findings of Bullwinkle , Reynolds et al . will help to improve our understanding of which activities in a cell are most affected by mistakes in protein synthesis , and how these mistakes may relate to disease ."," Scientists have found that when cells experience certain types of stress, they may produce an incorrect type of aminoacid (a building block needed to make proteins). This incorrect aminoaid could cause problems if it gets into the final protein product. To solve this problem, scientists discovered that some special enzymes called tRNAs help to keep track of which aminoaids go where during protein production. Without these helpful tRNA enzyme buddies, the wrong amino aid might get put into the protein instead of the right one! So, having enough of these helper friends around is really important for making good proteins. When there aren't enough of them around, things can go wrong and the cells won't work properly anymore. It's like playing a game of telephone where sometimes you miss a word because someone spoke too quietly or skipped a word on purpose. If everyone does their own thing, at the end of the line what comes out isn't always what was originally said! In this case, though, we know how to fix it – all we need is more helpers and everything will turn out just fine. Cool, huh? Science is pretty neat! 🤓🔬"
"Animal cells can secrete proteins and molecules into the space around them to create a support they can attach to . This structure – known as the extracellular matrix – comes in various forms and can help to shape tissues or influence the way in which cells behave . Inside cells , filaments made of a protein called actin also provide structural support . In fruit fly larvae , “tracheal” cells create a network of tubes that will form the airways of the adult fly . Once this network is complete , these cells secrete the materials to make an extracellular matrix in the internal ( apical ) surface of the tubes . This matrix has a series of spiralling ridges made from a molecule called chitin . These ridges run along the tubes , spanning several cells and providing the mechanical strength needed to keep the airways open . The ridges appear to form through a co-ordinated effort between the cells , and recent studies suggest that actin filaments may be involved in this process . Here , Öztürk-Çolak et al . investigate this idea further by carrying out a detailed analysis of the relationship between the extracellular matrix and the tracheal cells as the airways develop . The experiments reveal that rings of actin filaments form on the apical side of tracheal cells before the ridges appear . These rings generate regular folds in the membrane that surrounds each tracheal cell and are required for an enzyme to accumulate in the cells . This enzyme produces chitin , leading to its deposition in stripes above the actin rings . Further experiments show that the junctions between cells play an important role in organising the pattern of the extracellular matrix . The active form of a protein called Src42A – which is known to regulate the way actin filaments are organized inside cells – accumulates at these junctions . Excessive Src42A activity in tracheal cells alters the networks of actin filaments and disrupts the formation of the matrix . Öztürk-Çolak et al . also find evidence of a “feedback” mechanism , in which the presence of chitin reduces the activity of Src42A to maintain the correct patterning of actin . These findings reveal that actin and junctions between cells play a central role in co-ordinating the formation of the extracellular matrix in fruit fly airways . The next challenge will be to understand which proteins and other molecules are involved in the process that allows the extracellular matrix to communicate with the cells ."," In living things like flies or humans, different types of cells work together to make up organs such as muscles, hearts, lungs, etc. These groups of cells need to be connected properly so they can function well. To do this, each type of cell makes its own unique extracelullar matrix (ECM) which helps hold them all together. But how does each cell know what kind of ECM it needs to make? And how do these cells communicate with one another to make sure everything fits together perfectly? Scientists have found out that some cells actually get clues from other nearby cells about what kind ECM to make! This happens because when two cells come close enough, they can pass messages back and forth through special proteins called receptors. By doing this, cells can sense whether they're near other cells of the same type or not. If they aren't, then they start making more ECM than usual. That way, both cells will eventually end up surrounded by just the right amount of EMC. It's like if you were building something with your friends – say, a big tower made out of blocks – you might notice if someone wasn't putting in as many blocks as everyone else. So you could tell them to add more blocks or even make some yourself! Just like in our bodies, everything works better when everything fits nicely together."
"Should you go for coffee with Jules , or go to the movie theater with Jim ? Both options require you to make additional decisions , for example , which café would you go to , or what movie could you see ? Many of the decisions we make in our daily lives feature a number of sub-decisions . Many of our day-to-day decisions have multiple layers of sub-decisions embedded within them that are not necessarily independent . Our opinions of the cafés in town and the movies showing at the theater may influence our decision over whom to spend the afternoon with . In 2015 , researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience performed experiments in macaques to try to work out how the brain makes these decisions . The monkeys learned to choose between two visual stimuli ( decision 1 ) . The outcome of decision 1 determined whether the animals then had to make decision 2 or decision 3 . The results suggested that the monkeys initially made all three comparisons independently and in parallel , before combining the evidence to select their overall strategy . This process is referred to as hierarchical decision-making . In the original analogy , one would compare the relative merits of Jules versus Jim , café A versus café B , and a horror movie versus a comedy at the same time before deciding what to do . Other researchers have now reanalyzed the data from the original work using new computer simulations . This second analysis suggests that the results are more consistent with an alternative model of decision-making called a flat model , in which the brain compares all of the final options simultaneously ( Jules + café A; Jules + café B; Jim + horror movie; Jim + comedy ) before making a decision . In response to these findings , Zylberberg et al . – who conducted the work reported in 2015 – reanalyzed the original data and re-ran the simulations . Zylberberg et al . argue that the flat model provides a poor fit to the original data . A new experiment with human volunteers suggests that modifying the task by adding even more decisions can lead to the different comparisons being made one after the other ( in series ) rather than all at the same time ( in parallel ) , before the decision is made . This is difficult to explain with a flat model . Zylberberg et al . argue that these findings confirm the original conclusion that the monkeys use a hierarchical strategy . Moreover , the new results expose a previously unknown limit in the number of decisions that the brain can evaluate at any one time . If this limit is exceeded , decision-making becomes serial . Future studies can build on these findings by further exploring the limits of parallel decision-making , which may help us to understand how the brain is able to make multiple decisions while keeping the future consequences in mind ."," This article describes how people make decisions when they have to solve problems that involve several steps or levels. For example, imagine you need to get from your house to a destination, but there are many roads to take. Which one do you choose? If it’s just a straight shot versus a longer route, the choice may be easy. But what if you had to go through some construction areas along the way? Would it still be worth taking the long road? These types of decisions require us to consider different factors like distance, traffic, and potential delays. To figure out the best option, we usually weigh all our options before deciding. Sometimes this process happens quickly, while at others it takes more time. Researchers found that humans can make these kinds of decisions very efficiently because we use something called “hierarchy”—a system that helps us organize and prioritize the things we want to achieve. They used brain imaging techniques to show that we start off by comparing all our possible options at once, then later decide whether we should focus on specific parts of those options. By breaking down big decisions into smaller ones, we can save mental energy and make better choices. So next time you have to plan a trip or solve a puzzle, remember to break it up into smaller pieces!"
"Many things in the world have a certain structure to them , which we can use to organize our thinking . To mentally represent your family , for example , you could group your family members into men and women , or group them based on where they live . But a more intuitive approach for most people is to organize family members by generation: child , sibling , parent , grandparent . It is as though we instinctively place each family member along a mental line , from young to old . We use mental lines to organize other types of information too , most notably numbers . But can we also use them to represent new information ? Luyckx et al . trained healthy volunteers to associate pictures of six different colored donkeys with six different reward probabilities . One donkey was followed by reward 5% of the time , another was followed by reward 95% of the time , and so on . Through trial and error , the volunteers learned to rank the donkeys in terms of how likely they were to precede a reward . Luyckx et al . then compared the volunteers’ brain activity while viewing the donkeys to their brain activity while viewing the numbers 1 to 6 . The donkeys evoked patterns of electrical brain activity corresponding to the number that signaled their place on a mental line . Thus , donkey 1 , with the lowest reward probability , produced a pattern of brain activity similar to that of the number 1 , and so on for the others . This suggests that rather than learning in an unstructured way , we use past knowledge of relations among stimuli to organize new information . This phenomenon is called structural alignment . The results of Luyckx et al . provide the first evidence from brain activity to support structural alignment . They suggest that we use a general understanding of how the world is structured to learn new things . This could be relevant to both education and artificial intelligence . People , and computers , may learn more effectively if taught about the relations between items , rather than just the items in isolation ."," In this study, researchers wanted to understand how people make decisions based on rewards or punishments. They found that when people saw different symbols representing numbers, certain parts of their brain responded differently depending on whether those numbers indicated small or large amounts. When it came time to choose between two options, one option was more likely to give a ""reward"" than another option. Researchers found that these choices were also linked to the part of the brain that responds to numbers. This suggests that people use the same part of their brains to think about both numbers and rewards. By understanding how these two things work together, researchers may be able to help people better decide which actions will lead to good outcomes. For example, if someone has to pick between two jobs, but don’t know much about either job, they could compare them using factors like salary or benefits, which would activate similar areas of the brains associated with thinking about money. Overall, this study helps us understand how our brains process information related to rewards and punishements. It also provides some insight into how we might best approach decision making tasks. However, further studies need to be conducted before any firm conclusions can be drawn from this initial finding. Future research should investigate other types of decisions where similar principles apply, such as choosing between food items based on taste preference."
"Salmonellae are a group of bacteria that can cause vomiting and diarrhea if we consume contaminated food . Once in the bowel , the bacteria get inside our cells , where they stay in a compartment called the vacuole . This environment is very acidic , and the inside of the microbes also becomes more acidic in response . This change helps Salmonella to switch on genes that allow them to survive and infect humans , but it is still unclear how this mechanism takes place . To investigate this question , Liew , Foo et al . harnessed a recent technique called super-resolution imaging , which lets scientists see individual molecules in a cell . First , the technique was used to count a protein called SsrB as well as the enzyme that activates it , SsrA . The role of SsrB is to bind to DNA and turn on genes involved in making proteins that help Salmonella thrive . These studies revealed that the levels of SsrA/B proteins increased three-fold in an acidic environment . Then , Liew , Foo et al . followed SsrB inside cells , knowing that fast-moving particles are free in solution , while slow-moving particles are typically bound to DNA . In acidic conditions , the proportion of SsrB bound to DNA doubled . Finally , further experiments revealed that when the environment was acidic , SsrB became five times more likely to bind to DNA . Taken together , the results suggest that acidic conditions trigger a cascade of events which switch on genetic information that allows Salmonella to survive . If SsrB could be prevented from responding to acid stress , it could potentially stop Salmonella from surviving inside host cells . This knowledge should be applied to drive new treatment strategies for Salmonella and other microbes that infect human cells ."," In this study, researchers used advanced technology called super resolution imaging to examine how bacteria behave inside host cells. They found that when bacteria are inside a host cell, they experience lower pH than outside the cell. When exposed to these conditions, bacteria activate their genes responsible for making proteins that help them survive in the harsh environment of the host cell. These findings suggest that changing the pH of the environment could be a way to stop bacteria from causing disease. By understanding more about how bacteria respond to different environments, scientists can develop new ways to treat diseases caused by bacteria. Overall, this study provides important insights into how bacteria adapt to different environmental conditions. It also suggests potential targets for developing treatments to prevent or cure bacterial infections. Further studies on this topic may lead to new therapies for treating infectious diseases. However, further investigation is needed before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the specific mechanisms involved in this process. Future research should focus on identifying the exact molecular changes that occur during this adaptation process and determining how these changes affect bacterial behavior within host cells over time. Such knowledge would provide valuable information for designing effective therapeutics against various types of bacterial infection. Additionally, future studies should investigate whether similar processes occur in other types of bacteria and if they play a role in antibiotic resistance."
"Cancers develop when cells in the body divide rapidly in an uncontroled manner . It is generally possible to cure cancers that remain contained within a small area . However , if the tumor cells start to move , the cancer may spread in the body and become life threatening . Currently , most of the anti-cancer treatments act to reduce the multiplication of these cells , but not their ability to migrate . A signal protein called Ras stimulates human cells to grow and move around . In healthy cells , the activity of Ras is tightly controled to ensure cells only divide and migrate at particular times , but in roughly 30% of all human cancers , Ras is abnormally active . Ras switches on another protein , named RalB , which is also involved in inappropriate cell migration . Yet , it is not clear how RalB is capable to help Ras trigger the migration of cells . Zago et al . used an approach called optogenetics to specifically activate the RalB protein in human cells using a laser that produces blue light . When activated , the light-controlled RalB started abnormal cell migration; this was used to dissect which molecules and mechanisms were involved in the process . Taken together , the experiments showed that , first , Ras ‘turns on’ RalB by changing the location of two proteins that control RalB . Then , the activated RalB regulates the exocyst , a group of proteins that travel within the cell . In turn , the exocyst recruits another group of proteins , named the Wave complex , which is part of the molecular motor required for cells to migrate . Zago et al . also found that , in patients , the RalB protein was present at abnormally high levels in samples of breast cancer cells that had migrated to another part of the body . Overall , these findings indicate that the role of RalB protein in human cancers is larger than previously thought , and they highlight a new pathway that could be a target for new anti-cancer drugs ."," In this study, researchers used an innovative technique called ""optogenetics"" to activate a molecule called Ral B in cells. They discovered that activating Ral-B causes the movement of another group of proteins called the WRC to move from inside the cell to the outside of the cell. When these proteins moved outward, they caused the formation of new structures that helped cancer cells invade other areas around them. Researchers also learned that when RAS, which is often overactive in cancer cells, becomes activated it sends messages through RAL-B to cause the WCR to move out of the cells. Finally, researchers looked at how well RAL B was working in different types of breast cancer cells. What they found was that RAL levels were higher in more advanced stages of breast can cancer compared to less advanced ones. Overall, their findings suggest that RAS may use RAL to help promote the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body. These results could lead to new ways to treat patients who have advanced forms of breast or lung cancer. For example, drugs could be developed that block the activity of RAL in cancerous cells so that they cannot grow and spread throughout the body as easily. Alternatively, treatments might be designed to increase the amount of RAS in cancer tissues, which would then send signals to stop RAL from being active."
"Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in cells . It forms networks of filaments that provide structural support and generate the forces needed for cell movement , division , and many other processes in cells . Filaments of actin continuously change in length as actin molecules are added or removed at the ends . One end of an actin filament—called the barbed-end—grows much faster than the other , known as the pointed-end . Many other proteins also help the actin filaments to form . Some of these proteins bind to the ends of the filaments , where they directly control the growth of the filaments . Other proteins bind along the length of the filaments , but how these ‘side-binding’ proteins influence the growth of filaments is not clear . In this study , Crevenna et al . used a technique called ‘total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy’ to study how several side-binding proteins affect the growth of actin filaments in an artificial system . The growth of the barbed-ends was strongly influenced by which side-binding protein was interacting with the filament . For example , the barbed-end grew rapidly when a protein called VASP was present but grew more slowly in the presence of the protein α-actinin . Although the growth at the pointed-end was generally slow and sporadic , the side-binding proteins also had noticeable effects . Crevenna et al . found that when the side-binding proteins were present at low levels , filament growth was similar for all proteins studied . It was only when the proteins were present at higher levels that the growth of the actin filaments was altered depending on the specific side-binding protein present . One side-binding protein called α-actinin also altered the shape of the actin filament so that when it was present at high levels , the filaments curved in a particular direction . Together , these results suggest that the growth , structure , and flexibility of actin filaments can be strongly influenced by the various proteins that bind along the length of the filaments . The next challenges are to understand the precise details of how these side-binding proteins are able to alter the growth and shape of actin and investigate how they influence other processes that control the structure of actin networks in cells ."," Actin is an important protein found inside cells that helps them move around or change shape. To do these things, actin needs to be able to grow longer or shorter depending on what the cell wants it to do. Scientists have known that one end of actins grows faster than the other, but they didn't know why. They used special microscopes to watch individual actins growing over time and discovered that different proteins bind to actins at different times while they are growing. These proteins help control how fast the actin grows. This means that there might be more ways to make actins work better than scientists first thought! By understanding how all these proteins work together, scientists could find new ways to use actins to treat diseases like cancer or heart disease. For example, if they knew exactly which proteins were best at making actins grow into certain shapes, then they could add those proteins into sick cells to fix them. Or maybe they could figure out how to turn off bad proteins that don’t let actins do what they need to do properly. That would be pretty cool! 🤩. (Lay Summary) 150 words. 8 years old. 4th grade. USA"
"The body produces proteins by transcribing DNA ( genes ) to make messenger RNA , which is then translated to make a protein . Transcription begins when an enzyme called RNA polymerase binds to the DNA and catalyzes the process by which genetic information from the double helix is copied to a complementary RNA transcript , which subsequently becomes the messenger RNA . Because a living cell usually contains only one or a few copies ( alleles ) of a given gene , molecular fluctuations play a crucial role in cellular transcription . Therefore , studying transcription kinetics at the level of single molecules may provide critical insights into how cells deal with—or even take advantage of—molecular fluctuations . A number of different single-molecule techniques can be used to follow transcription , but these techniques are often relatively slow compared to transcription in living cells , or they suffer from other problems such as only being able to study one step in the transcription process . Now , Zhang , Revyakin et al . have systematically devised a technique called ‘fastFISH’ that is fast enough to track the production of single RNA molecules directly and instantaneously . FastFISH builds on an existing technique called FISH—short for fluorescence in situ hybridization—in which fluorescent molecules are attached to single strands of DNA or RNA . These single strands pair with specific regions of complementary DNA or RNA molecules , and they can be visualized with a fluorescence microscope . However , conventional FISH is a ‘snap-shot’ technique that is not suitable for making real-time observations under physiological conditions . FastFISH relies on single strands of fluorescently labeled DNA and RNA that bind to complementary strands of DNA or RNA extremely quickly , even under physiological conditions , because they contain only three of the four ‘regular’ nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA . As a proof of principle , Zhang , Revyakin et al . used fastFISH to study the kinetics of transcription by the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and were able to measure multiple stages of the transcription cycle in a single-molecule experimental setup . By allowing each stage of transcription to be tracked in real-time at the level of single-molecules , fastFISH will permit a more in-depth analysis of the factors that regulate how genes are expressed as proteins in our cells . Moreover , the ability to design single-strand probes that bind rapidly to DNA and RNA targets could have many additional applications , including new strategies for more efficient gene silencing ."," Transcription is when DNA makes copies called RNA inside our cells. This happens randomly because there's not enough room for all the molecules to fit into the cell at once. It also happens slowly because some parts take longer than others. Scientists have found ways to watch this happen using tiny flashes of light from special dyes. They did this really well by making a new way to make things stick together quickly so they could see each part of the copying happen faster than before. Now scientists know more about how these random copies happen over time. In the future, this knowledge might help doctors find better treatments or cures for diseases.

"Cells switch their genes on or off in order to respond to changes in their environment . A group of proteins called histones are partly responsible for regulating gene activity . Like all proteins , histones are made from smaller building blocks called amino acids . Enzymes can chemically modify specific amino acids in histone proteins , which allows the histones to switch nearby genes on or off . One of these modifications is called methylation , and the methylation of specific “lysine” amino acids in histone proteins regulates gene activity in different ways . Previous research has shown that , in certain types of cancer cells , lysines that can be methylated are often replaced with another amino acid , a methionine . These substitutions stop the histones from correctly controlling the activity of nearby genes because methionine cannot be methylated like lysine . Additionally , even if only a small number of histones have methionine in place of lysine , this change can have a widespread effect because the few histones with the methionine can block other histones from being methylated too . However , previous studies did not provide a clear mechanism for why this is the case . In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe an enzyme called Clr4 methylates a histone protein at a lysine named H3K9 . Now , Shan , Wang , Xu et al . show that substituting this lysine with a methionine ( referred to as H3K9M ) stops the widespread methylation of histones by trapping the Clr4 enzyme . Specifically , Clr4 becomes stuck to the H3K9M histones , and is therefore unable to modify any other histones . Shan et al . went on to carry out a more detailed study of the structure of H3K9M attached to another enzyme called G9a . This enzyme is found in human cells and is similarly inhibited by H3K9M . This investigation identified additional chemical interactions that explain why Clr4 and G9a become trapped by the H3K9M histone but not by normal histones . Future studies are needed to explore whether other altered histones are able to trap enzymes in the way that H3K9M traps Clr4 and G9a . In addition , this work could eventually lead to new cancer therapies ."," Scientists have found that certain changes called ""histone modifications"" occur when cancer develops. These changes involve replacing specific amino acids in proteins called histones. Specifically, these changes replace the amino acid lysin with another amino called methionin. This change happens because some cells become cancerous. When this occurs, it prevents other cells from becoming cancerous as well. It does so by blocking the spread of cancerous cells throughout the body. To understand how this works, scientists studied this process using yeasts. They discovered that changing just one copy of the gene encoding the protein histone 3 did not affect the overall level of methyldesination of histones in the cell. However, it was able to stop the methlydesination of all histones completely. Furthermore, this modification increased the binding between the modified histone and a protein called Clr6, which helps maintain the integrity of chromosomes. Finally, researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the modified version of the histone bound to a protein involved in methyling histones called G9b. They found that the new amino changed the way the two molecules interacted with each other. Based on these findings, researchers were able to better understand how cancer affects the development of cancer cells."
"In animals , an enzyme known as RNA polymerase II ( Pol II for short ) is a key element of the transcription process , whereby the genetic information contained in DNA is turned into messenger RNA molecules in the cells , which can then be translated to proteins . To perform this task , Pol II needs to be activated by a complex of proteins called P-TEFb; however , P-TEFb is usually found in an inactive form held by another group of proteins . Yet , it is unclear how P-TEFb is released and allowed to activate Pol II . Scientists have speculated that another protein called JMJD6 ( Jumonji domain-containing 6 ) is important for P-TEFb to activate Pol II . Various roles for JMJD6 have been proposed , but its exact purpose remains unclear . Recently , two enzymes closely related to JMJD6 were found to be able to make precise cuts in other proteins; Lee , Liu et al . therefore wanted to test whether this is also true of JMJD6 . Experiments using purified JMJD6 showed that it could make a cut in an enzyme called MePCE , which belongs to the group of proteins that hold P-TEFb in its inactive form . Lee , Liu et al . then tested the relationships between these proteins in living human and mouse cells . The levels of activated Pol II were lower in cells without JMJD6 and higher in those without MePCE . Together , the results suggest that JMJD6 cuts MePCE to release P-TEFb , which then activates Pol II . JMJD6 appears to know where to cut by following a specific pattern of elements in the structure of MePCE . When MePCE was mutated so that the pattern changed , JMJD6 was unable to cut it . These results suggest that JMJD6 and related enzymes belong to a new family of proteases , the molecular scissors that can cleave other proteins . The molecules that regulate transcription often are major drug targets , for example in the fight against cancer . Ultimately , understanding the role of JMJD6 might help to identify new avenues for cancer drug development ."," Scientists have discovered that there is an important process called ""promoter-proximally paused"" which happens when certain molecules bind to another type of molecule called ""positive transcriptional elongations factors b"". This can prevent the production of some types of protein. To fix this problem, scientists found another molecule that they think will help solve it. They named this new molecule ""JMVD6."" Then, they used different ways like using crystals or special chemicals to test if their idea was right. Their results showed that JVMD6 might be able to break apart the molecules that were causing the problem so that the positive transcriptive elongational factors could do their job properly again. Overall, these findings suggest that JVMVD6 may play an important role in helping cells make more of certain kinds of proteins. However, more studies need to be done before we know for sure whether JMVD is helpful or not. For example, researchers should check if JMVSD helps other people who have health problems caused by problems with making enough of certain proteins in their bodies. If those tests show good results, then doctors might be allowed to use JMVED to treat patients. But first, scientists need to learn much more about what JMDED does inside our bodies."
"Sexual reproduction – that is , the combination of sex cells from two different individuals to produce an embryo – is one of the many mechanisms that have evolved to maintain genetic diversity . Most human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes , with each chromosome in a pair carrying either a paternal or maternal copy of the same gene . To form an embryo with the right number of chromosomes , each sex cell ( the egg or sperm cell ) must only contain one chromosome from each pair . Sex cells are produced from parent cells containing two sets of paternal and maternal chromosomes: these cells then divide twice to form four sex cells which contain only one chromosome from each pair . Before the parent cell divides , a process known as ‘recombination’ takes place , which allows chromosomes in a pair to exchange bits of genetic information . This reshuffling ensures that each chromosome in a sex cell is unique . A protein called PRDM9 helps control which sections of genetic information are recombined by modifying proteins attached to the chromosomes , marking them as locations for exchange . The DNA at each of these sites is then broken and repaired using the genetic sequence of the chromosome it is paired with as a template , thus causing the two chromosomes to swap genes . In 2019 , a group of researchers found a set of genes in the testis of mice that are expressed at the same time as the gene for PRDM9 . This suggested that another protein called ZCWPW1 is likely involved in recombination , but the precise role of this protein was unclear . To answer this question , Wells , Bitoun et al . – including many of the researchers involved in the 2019 study – examined human cells grown in the laboratory to determine where ZCWPW1 binds to in the chromosome . This revealed that ZCWPW1 can be found at the same sites as PRDM9 , which is responsible for bringing it there . Furthermore , cells from male mice lacking the gene for ZCWPW1 cannot complete the exchange of genetic information between chromosomes , meaning that the mice are infertile . As such , ZCWPW1 seems to connect location selection by PRDM9 to the DNA repair mechanisms needed for gene exchange between chromosomes . Infertility is a significant issue for humans affecting as many as one in every six couples . Fertility is complex and many of the biological mechanisms involved are not fully understood . This work suggests that both PRDM9 and ZCWPW1 are key to the production of sex cells and may be worth investigating as factors that affect fertility in humans ."," During reproduction, two copies of each gene from parents combine together to make one copy in their offspring. This process called ""recombination"" happens between pairs of genes on the same chromosome. To ensure accurate recombining, there must be an exchange of DNA segments between paired chromosomal regions. For this purpose, during early stages of cell division, special enzymes known as ""double-stranded breaks"" or DSB cut open the DNA molecule at specific locations along the chromosones. These cuts then get repaired using proteins such as ZCWPPW1 which helps bring the broken ends close together again. It was found that these proteins recognize certain patterns on the DNA sequence. One such pattern is made up of three chemical markers on the histone proteins. A second protein named PRDM 9 can also recognize this pattern and help recruit other proteins including ZCWWPW1. Without ZCWNPPW 1, the DSB repairs itself incorrectly leading to problems in the next generation. Therefore, it is important to understand how ZCNNPPWl works so that we can find ways to fix any problems caused by its absence. Overall, our study shows that ZCNWWPWL plays an important role in making sure that the right amount of genetic material gets passed onto future generations."
"The genetic material inside cells is often packaged into thread-like structures called chromosomes . In humans , mice and other mammals , a pair of sex chromosomes determines the genetic or chromosomal sex of each individual . Those who inherit two “X” chromosomes are said to be chromosomally female , while chromosomal males have one “X” and one “Y” chromosome . This means females have twice as many copies of genes on the X chromosome as a male does , which turns out to be double the number that the body needs . To solve this problem , mammals have developed a strategy known as dosage compensation . The second X chromosome in females becomes “silent”: its DNA remains unchanged , but none of the genes are active . A long noncoding RNA molecule called Xist is responsible for switching off the extra X genes in female cells . It does this by coating the entirety of the second X chromosome . Normally , RNA molecules transmit the coded instructions in genes to the cellular machinery that manufactures proteins . “Noncoding” RNAs like Xist , however , are RNAs that have taken on different jobs inside the cell . Researchers believe that the ancestral Xist gene may have once encoded a protein but changed over time to produce only a noncoding RNA . Carter , Xu et al . therefore set out to find out how exactly this might have happened , and also how Xist might have acquired its ability to switch genes off . Initial experiments used mouse cells grown in the laboratory , in which a protein called Spen was deleted . Spen is known to help Xist silence the X chromosome . In female cells lacking Spen , the second X chromosome remained active . Other chromosomes in male and female cells also had stretches of DNA that became active upon Spen’s removal . These DNA sequences , termed endogenous retroviruses , were remnants of ancestral viral infections . In other words , Spen normally acted as an antiviral defense . Analysis of genetic sequences showed that Spen recognized endogenous retrovirus sequences resembling a key region in Xist , a region which was needed for Xist to work properly . Inserting fragments of endogenous retroviruses into a defective version of Xist lacking this region also partially restored its ability to inactivate genes , suggesting that X chromosome silencing might work by hijacking cellular defenses against viruses . That is , female cells essentially ‘pretend’ there is a viral infection on the second X chromosome by coating it with Xist ( which mimics endogenous retroviruses ) , thus directing Spen to shut it down . This research is an important step towards understanding how female cells carry out dosage compensation in mammals . More broadly , it sheds new light on how ancient viruses may have shaped the evolution of noncoding RNAs in the human genome ."," In this study, researchers found out how certain genes on our DNA called ""endogenous retrotransposons"" or ""ERVs"" can be turned off by another type of gene called ""XIST."" This process is important because it helps balance the number of copies of male and female genes inside our bodies. Researchers have already known that XIST works together with a protein called SPERMINE NUCLEAR PROTEIN (SPEN) to turn off ERVs. They also knew that SPEN binds tightly to XIST. However, they did not know if SPEN could also bind to ERXs. To find out, researchers used special techniques to look at whether SPEN was bound to ERSs. Their experiments showed that SPENT can indeed bind to ERVEs. Furthermore, when SPEN levels were low, some ERV genes became more active than normal. Finally, researchers discovered that SPEND binds very closely to part of the XIST gene called the ""A repeat"". It turns out that the A repeat has a structure that looks like parts of other types of genes called ""retrotransposon"", which are often controlled by XIST during the process of turning them off. Based on their findings, researchers think that XISIT might use its ability to bind to SPEN to help control the activity of retrotransposition genes."
"The immune system is composed of many types of cells that can recognize foreign molecules and pathogens so they can eliminate them . When cells in the body become infected with a pathogen , they can process the pathogen’s proteins and present them on their own surface . Specialized immune cells can then recognize infected cells and interact with them , forming an ‘immunological synapse’ . These synapses play an important role in immune response: they activate the immune system and allow it to kill harmful cells . To form an immunological synapse , an immune cell must reorganize its internal contents , including an aster-shaped scaffold made of tiny protein tubes called microtubules . The center of this scaffold moves towards the immunological synapse as it forms . This re-orientation of the microtubules towards the immunological synapse is known as 'polarization' and it happens very rapidly , but it is not yet clear how it works . One molecule involved in the polarization process is called KIF21B , a protein that can walk along microtubules , building up at the ends and affecting their growth . Whether KIF21B makes microtubules grow more quickly , or more slowly , is a matter of debate , and the impact microtubule length has on immunological synapse formation is unknown . Here , Hooikaas , Damstra et al . deleted the gene for KIF21B from human immune cells called T cells to find out how it affected their ability to form an immunological synapse . Without KIF21B , the T cells grew microtubules that were longer than normal , and had trouble forming immunological synapses . When the T cells were treated with a drug that stops microtubule growth , their ability to form immunological synapses was restored , suggesting a role for KIF21B . To explore this further , Hooikaas , Damstra et al . replaced the missing KIF21B gene with a gene that coded for a version of the protein that could be seen using microscopy . This revealed that , when KIF21B reaches the ends of microtubules , it stops their growth and triggers their disassembly . Computational modelling showed that cells find it hard to reorient their microtubule scaffolding when the individual tubes are too long . It only takes a small number of KIF21B molecules to shorten the microtubules enough to allow the center of the scaffold to move . Research has linked the KIF21B gene to autoimmune conditions like multiple sclerosis . Microtubules also play an important role in cell division , a critical process driving all types of cancer . Drugs that affect microtubule growth are already available , and a deeper understanding of KIF21B and microtubule regulation in immune cells could help to improve treatments in the future ."," When immune cells called T cells come into contact with other types of immune cells, they need to change their shape so that they can move forward towards the contacted cell. This movement requires the T cell to push its centrosomes (which act as guides) towards the front part of the cell. To do this, the T cells use tiny filaments inside the cell called microtublules. These microtulbules help the centrioles move forward by pushing them from behind. However, when there is too much pressure on these microtuberlues, they break apart and cannot be used anymore. Scientists have found out that one type of protein called KIF 21 B helps keep the right balance between pushing and breaking down of these microtbules. Without it, the microtubeules become longer than normal and cannot guide the centriosles properly. As a result, the centrousles get stuck at the back of the T-cell and cannot move forward. By adding another drug that breaks down the microtbule, scientists were able to fix this problem and make the T -cells work again normally. Overall, this study shows us that proteins like KIF-21-B play very important roles in helping our bodies fight against diseases such as cancer or viral infection."
"A nematode worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans is often used in the laboratory to study how animals grow and develop . There are two types of C . elegans worm: hermaphrodite individuals produce both female sex cells ( eggs ) and male sex cells ( sperm ) , while male individuals only produce sperm . The hermaphrodite worms are able to reproduce without mating with another worm , allowing populations of C . elegans to grow rapidly when they are living in favorable conditions . However , when the hermaphrodites do mate with males they tend to produce more offspring . These offspring are also usually healthier because they receive a mixture of genetic material from two different parents . Although mating is beneficial for the survival of a species it can also harm an individual animal . Previous studies have shown that mating with male worms can accelerate aging of hermaphrodite worms and cause premature death . However , it remained unclear whether hermaphrodite worms have evolved any mechanisms to protect themselves after mating with a male . To address this question , Booth et al . used genetic techniques to study the lifespans of hermaphrodite worms . The experiments found that the hermaphrodites’ own sperm ( known as self-sperm ) regulated a sperm-sensing signaling pathway that protected them from the negative impact of mating with males . Hermaphrodites with self-sperm that mated with males lived for a similar length of time as hermaphrodites that did not mate . On the other hand , hermaphrodites that did not have self-sperm ( because they were older or had a genetic mutation ) had shorter lifespans after mating than worms that did not mate . Modulating the sperm-sensing signaling pathway in worms that lacked self-sperm was sufficient to protect them from the negative effects of mating with males . Further experiments found that the hermaphrodites of another nematode worm called C . briggsae – which evolved self-sperm independently of C . elegans – also protected themselves from the negative effects of mating with males in a similar way . This suggests that other animals may also have evolved similar mechanisms to protect themselves from harm when mating . A separate study by Shi et al . has found that the beneficial effects of self-sperm are mediated by a pathway linked to longevity that also exists in mammals . The results of both investigations combined suggest possible avenues for future research into the complex relationship between health , longevity , and reproduction ."," In some animals, having sex can be harmful or even deadly. For example, male lizards sometimes bite off part of the female tail during mating, which can lead to infection and death. Similarly, male elephant seals often mount females repeatedly during matting, causing them physical damage. Researchers wondered if these kinds of problems might exist in other animals too, like worms called Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). They already knew that males could harm females in C. elegants by biting them during mucus production. However, they didn't know if females had ways to fight back. To find out, researchers looked at how well different types of females did after being touched by a male. They found that younger females were less likely to die when touched by males compared to older ones. This was surprising because usually, younger individuals should be more vulnerable to attack! Further investigation showed that the reason younger females survived better was because they had something inside them called ""self-sperms"". These self-made sperm help protect younger females from getting hurt by males. It's important to note that this protective effect doesn't come from actually being fertilized (which is what most people think happens when you have sex). Instead, it comes from sensing the presence of sperm. So basically, just knowing there are sperm around is enough to make younger females safer!"
"Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It is currently the leading cause of death by a single microbe worldwide , claiming the lives of 1 . 5 million people annually . The disease is difficult to cure , as many strains of the bacterium have developed resistance to the main drugs used to treat the infection . This leaves physicians with few options to treat tuberculosis and control its spread . The spread of these drug-resistant strains is a major global public health problem . New strategies that do not lead to drug resistance are needed . One possibility would be to starve the bacterium . Like all living things , M . tuberculosis must eat to survive and spread . Right now , scientists do not know much about how this microbe eats . However , they do know that it needs nitrogen – an essential part of DNA , RNA , and proteins – to survive . Most bacteria like to consume ammonium as their main nitrogen source , but they may also use select amino acids as a nitrogen source . Now , Agapova et al . show that M . tuberculosis is not a picky eater . In the experiments , the bacteria were fed different nitrogen sources . Then , they tracked how well the bacteria grew . The experiments showed that M . tuberculosis happily eats many different amino acids and may use more than one as a nitrogen source at a time . It does not tightly control its stockpile of nitrogen sources the way other bacteria do , or use ammonium very efficiently . This suggests that M . tuberculosis has evolved to be very flexible in its dietary habits , which may explain why these bacteria can thrive in the varied environments within the human body . Knowing exactly how M . tuberculosis acquires and uses nitrogen may help scientists design ways to thwart the process and starve the bacteria ."," In this study, researchers wanted to understand how bacteria use aminoacids as a source of nitrogengaso they can survive.

"Proteins known as hypoxia-inducible factors ( HIFs ) are important in animals when the amount of oxygen in the air or water drops . These proteins switch on genes that help cells and tissues adapt to the shortage in oxygen , for example , by stimulating the production of red blood cells . Each HIF is made up of two subunits called α and β that only bind to each other when the oxygen levels drop . This two-subunit complex , or 'dimer' , then activates a set of genes by binding to a stretch of DNA known as the hypoxia response element . HIFs also play important roles in many different stages of animal development . There are many different HIF proteins that are each present at different developmental stages; this has made them difficult to study . Zhang et al . have found a new form of HIF-3α in zebrafish – called Hif-3α2 . The experiments show that this α subunit is not regulated by oxygen , but may still be able to activate genes that have the hypoxia response element . When Hif-3α2 was injected into zebrafish embryos , the body pattern that is normally set up in embryogenesis was disrupted . Further experiments revealed that Hif-3α2 regulates embryo development by destabilizing a protein called β-catenin . This inhibits a cell communication system called Wnt/β-catenin signaling . Zhang et al . also show that the two distinct activities of Hif-3α2 – binding to the hypoxia response element and destabilizing β-catenin – involve two different regions of the protein . Together , Zhang et al . ’s findings show that zebrafish Hif-3α2 combines some conventional features of HIF proteins with a unique developmental role . It is likely that human Hif-3α may also work in a similar way , so future studies will focus on understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for these distinct roles ."," In this study, researchers found that there was another type of Hipoxygen-Inducible Factor (HIF) called HIF-3a2 which had an important role during embryogenesis. Unlike other types of Hifs, HIF3a did not need oxygen to work. It could be found both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells. When it was present at high levels, it caused abnormalities in the size and shape of the body as well as problems with how the right side of the embryos developed. Researchers discovered that HIF 3a worked through binding to beta catenin, a key molecule involved in the process of cell division and differentiation. They showed that when HIF was added to the cells, the amount of beta catonin in the cells decreased. However, they also found out that this effect on beta catanin happened even under normal oxygen conditions. Therefore, Hif 3 alpha may play an important regulatory role in the Wnt pathway without requiring changes in oxygen concentration. This finding provides new insight into the function of HIPs and suggests that HIP-3alpha plays a unique role in controlling cell proliferation and differentiations."
"Stem cells have the rare ability to divide and specialize into the many different types of cells necessary for an organism to survive . For instance , germ stem cells can multiply to produce precursor cells that go on to become eggs or sperm needed for reproduction . When a stem cell divides , the daughter cells can either remain ‘naïve’ , or start to specialize into a given cell type . In many cases , this decision is strongly influenced by the properties of the environment that surrounds the stem cell . However , in the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans , how the daughters of germ stem cells specialize was thought to be a random process , with nearby cells equally likely to specialize or remain naïve . In this animal , germ stem cells reside in tube-shaped structures called gonads , which are enclosed by a large ‘distal tip’ cell . In addition , cells known as Sh1 surround the gonad . Here , Gordon et al . tracked dividing germ stem cells in the gonads of live worms . This revealed that both the distal tip cell and Sh1 cells have finger-like extensions that form contacts with the germ stem cells . The fate of dividing germ stem cells is shaped by these interactions . If they touch only the distal tip cell , they remain in a naïve state . However , if they contact both the distal tip cell and an Sh1 cell , one daughter of the stem cell becomes an egg precursor – with the daughter closest to the distal tip cell staying naïve . In fact , germ stem cells that are prevented from contacting Sh1 cells divide less often . Many other types of stem cells , for example in human skin , are believed to make the decision to remain naïve or undergo specialization randomly . The results from Gordon et al . could provide a roadmap to discover hidden layers of control in other organisms , some of which may be potentially relevant in health and disease ."," Scientists have found a way that stem cells can come out of their ""nest"" or niche. They used worms as an example because they have a special kind of stem cells called distal arm cells. These cells live inside the ""nests"" which help them stay stem cells. Sometimes these stem cells need to become regular cells instead of staying inside the nest all the time. To do this, the scientists found that another type of cell next to the nest helps push the stem cells out into the right place so they can turn into regular cells. This happens when two things happen together: first, the stem cell divides into two new cells; second, the new cells move away from the nest. Then the new stem cell goes back into the nest and stays there while the old one comes out. When the researchers blocked the movement of the helper cell, the cells did not know where to go! So, the nest keeps some cells inside and sends others out to be regular cells like it should. It's like having a safe spot for your toys and then sending them out to play sometimes. The researchers think that maybe this happens in people too, even though we don't really know yet. But now we know more about how stem cells work in worms!"
"Much of the work that has been done to understand how cells work has involved studying parts of a cell in isolation . This is particularly true of studies that have examined the arrangement of atoms in large molecules with elaborate structures like proteins or DNA . However , cells are densely packed with many different molecules and there is little proof that proteins keep the same structures inside cells that they have when they are studied alone . To really understand how cells work , new ways to understand how molecules behave inside cells are needed . While this cannot be achieved directly , technology has now reached the stage where we can , to some extent , study living cells by recreating them virtually . Simulated cells can copy the atomic details of all the molecules in a cell and can estimate how different molecules might behave together . Yu et al . have now developed a computer simulation of part of a cell from the bacterium , Mycoplasma genitalium , one of the simplest forms of life on Earth . This model suggested new possible interactions between molecules inside cells that cannot currently be studied in real cells . The model shows that some proteins have a much less rigid structure in cells than they do in isolation , whilst others are able to work together more closely to carry out certain tasks . Finally , the model predicted that small molecules such as food , water and drugs would move more slowly through cells as they become stuck or trapped by larger molecules . These results could be particularly important in helping to improve drug design . Currently the simulations are limited , and can only model parts of simple cells for less than a thousandth of a second . However , in future it should be possible to recreate larger and more complex cells , including human cells , for longer periods of time . These could be used to better study human diseases and help to design new treatments . The ultimate goal is to simulate a whole cell in full detail by combining all the available experimental data ."," Scientists used computer modeling to study what happens when different molecules interact inside cells. They looked at how these interactions affect the shape and movement of biological molecules like proteins or DNA. They did this by creating a ""virtual"" version of a bacteria's cytoplasma (the jelly-like part inside cells). Then they ran computer programs to see how the molecules behaved in this virtual environment. They found that some types of molecule can make it harder for other kinds of molecules to move around freely. For example, if there are too many proteins packed together, it becomes hard for small things like ions (which are charged particles) to move through the space between them. This could be a problem because many important processes happen only if certain parts of the cell can communicate easily with each other. So, having lots of proteints packed together might stop those processes from happening properly. On the other hand, the scientists also found that other types of mollecules seem to help keep the spaces open so that things can still move around. Overall, their results show that it's really important to understand how all the different kinds of biologcal molecules behave inside cells, because they all play a role in making sure everything works right."
"Influenza is caused by viruses that infect birds and mammals . These viruses enter cells when two lipid bilayers—one surrounding the virus , the other enclosing the cellular compartment into which the virus has been engulfed—merge to form a single unified membrane . This process , known as membrane fusion , allows the RNA of the virus to gain access to the host cell's molecular machinery , which it commandeers to produce multiple copies of itself and to direct the assembly of new virus particles . The process of membrane fusion generally includes an intermediate hemifused state in which only the adjacent monolayers from each bilayer have merged . In addition to its role in virology , membrane fusion is critical for many other biological processes , including exocytosis , protein trafficking and the fertilization of eggs by sperm . Efficient membrane fusion requires a catalyst , and a glycoprotein known as the influenza hemagglutinin performs this role for the influenza virus . The hemagglutinin is found on the surface of the virus , and a typical influenza virus particle can have a few hundred such molecules on its surface . When an influenza virus particle binds to the surface of a cell ( as a result of these hemagglutinin molecules interacting with cellular receptor molecules ) , the cell engulfs the virus into an internal compartment called an endosome . Acidification of the endosome , part of the cell's normal activity , triggers a sequence of conformational changes in the hemagglutinin molecules on the surface of the virus . One part of the hemagglutinin inserts itself into the endosomal membrane , and further conformational changes draw the endosomal and viral membranes together into an intermediate , hemifused state; the process then continues until fusion of the two membranes is complete . Previous work has suggested that an average of three hemagglutinin molecules are required to fuse the endosomal and viral membranes . Ivanovic et al . have now investigated the molecular details of this process and described the time course of conformational changes undergone by the hemagglutinin molecules from the moment the pH is lowered within the endosome until the time when hemifusion of the endosomal and viral membranes is complete . They find , among other things , that hemifusion proceeds rapidly only when three or four immediately adjacent hemagglutinin molecules have inserted into the endosomal membrane . Since membrane fusion is a very general cellular process , the findings of Ivanovic et al . are relevant to many areas of cell biology , in addition to having potential applications in virology ."," In this study, researchers used different methods to analyze how influenza A virus infects host cells through cellular membrane merging. They found that when an influenza virus binds to its receptor on the surface of a cell, it can trigger one or more proteins called hemagluttinin located at the tip of each spike on the virus's outer layer to change shape. These changes allow the virus to merge with the cell's membrane and enter the cell. Researchers also discovered that before the two membranes join, some parts of the protein need to be pulled away from their original position while other parts need to bend back towards themselves. Once all three parts of a particular protein perform these actions, they can work together with nearby proteins to help pull the two sides closer together until they eventually meet. However, because the process involves multiple steps, it takes a relatively long time for the two surfaces to come into contact. As a result, the entire process of infection is slow. Overall, this study provides new insights into how influenzavirus enters cells during infection. It may lead to better ways to develop vaccines against influenza. Further studies should focus on identifying additional factors that affect the speed of the infection process. For example, future research could investigate whether certain chemicals or molecules inside the body can accelerate the movement of hemagluittanin proteins, thereby reducing the risk of infection."
"The outer sheet of brain tissue , the neocortex , is composed of circuits formed from trillions of connections among billions of neurons , of which there are about one hundred different neuron types . The scale and complexity of cortical circuitry pose experimental challenges , leading to an incomplete understanding of how cortical cell types are connected and the computations that take place at the connections . About half of the cell types in the brain are excitatory , which means they can activate other cells . The cortex consists of several distinct layers of cells , within which excitatory cells cooperate to process the signals they receive from other cortical layers and brain areas . Using recordings of electrical activity arising from the connections between pairs of excitatory neurons , Seeman , Campagnola et al . measured the likelihood and strength of connectivity among related groups of excitatory cell types in slices of cortex taken from human and mouse brains . The initial results confirm previous findings that individual layers of human cortex can have more and stronger excitatory connections than the same layers of mouse cortex . In most layers of mouse cortex , repeatedly activating the excitatory cells leads to progressively weaker responses . However , in the upper layers of mouse cortex , the opposite effect is sometimes seen: more excitatory activity causes the connections to generate stronger responses . By feeding these data into a computer model , Seeman , Campagnola et al . described and compared the activity of the groups of related excitatory cell types . These results are the first of a new , large-scale project where findings can be integrated across experiments to gain a more detailed picture of cortical circuitry and computation . Neuroscientists will be able to use the results to build advanced computer models of cortical circuits . Such models will , for example , generate predictions for how the attributes of excitatory connectivity revealed by Seeman , Campagnola et al . influence how information is processed in the cortex . In so doing , the models will add to our understanding of how the human brain works both in health and in disease ."," Scientists want to learn more about how different types of brain cells work together in the brain. They used special tools to study this question in mice and humans. In both animals, they found that some kinds of brain cell sometimes talk to other kinds of nearby brain cells. This happens often enough to be important, but not so much that it would cause problems. When these brain cells communicate with each other, it usually makes them stop talking quickly, but sometimes it can make them keep talking faster instead. This finding helps us understand how groups of brain neurons might work together. It also shows that even though people and mice brains may look very different, they seem to use similar rules for how their brain cells talk to each other. This could help scientists build better computer programs to study how the brain works. It could also help doctors figure out ways to fix communication problems between brain cells when things go wrong.

"For most animals , mating and fighting are critical for survival and reproduction . These behaviors are also closely related and share similar actions . How are such complex behaviors hard-wired into the brain ? A fruit fly called Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent system to investigate this problem , because flies mate and fight , and powerful genetic tools are available to probe the circuits of neurons that control these behaviors . A great deal has been learned recently about the neural circuits that control mating , but much less was known about how the circuits for aggression are organized . Hoopfer et al . systematically activated different sets of neurons in thousands of male flies to try to find the circuits that trigger aggression . While this identified some neurons that specifically promoted aggression , it also uncovered a cluster – called P1 neurons – that promoted both aggression and courtship . This was unexpected , because P1 neurons were previously thought to only control courtship behavior . The P1 neurons produced different behaviors at different stimulation thresholds , with the neurons requiring a stronger level of activation to promote courtship instead of aggression . Moreover , the P1 neurons triggered a lasting change in the internal state of the male that increased his tendency to engage in aggression or courtship . These results are reminiscent of observations made in mice , suggesting small groups of neurons that control mating and fighting may represent an evolutionarily conserved neural circuit ""motif"" for the control of social behavior . The next step is to figure out how P1 neurons trigger a persistent internal state of arousal or motivation , and to determine whether and how this circuitry participates in the ""decision"" to engage in mating or fighting ."," In this study, researchers used fruit flies (Drosophilia melanogaster) as a model organism to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying aggressive behaviour. They found that certain types of brain cells called ""interneurons"" play a crucial role in promoting aggressive behaviour in males. These interneuronal cells, known as P1 cells, have been shown to be involved in another type of fly behaviour called courtship. By using genetic tools and light-sensitive proteins, they showed that activating P1 cell activity can increase aggressive behaviour between two male flies. This effect occurs even when the flies do not show physical signs of aggression such as lunging or biting each other. Instead, it appears that activations of P1 causes a long-lasting change inside the flies' bodies which makes them more likely to engage in aggressive behaviours later on. Interestingly, high levels of P2 cell activity seem to counteract the effects of PI cell activation, suggesting that there may be multiple layers of regulation controlling aggressive behaviour within the fly brain. Overall, this study provides new insights into our understanding of how different parts of the nervous system work together to regulate complex behaviours like aggression. It also highlights the importance of considering non-visible changes in the body when studying animal behaviour."
"Most living organisms package their DNA into bundles called chromosomes . These chromosomes generally form pairs , with each chromosome in the pair containing the same number of genes . The genes also come in the same order , but the exact sequence of DNA bases within the genes can be different . When sex cells—such as egg , sperm or pollen cells—are made , each pair of chromosomes is separated so that the each sex cell contains only half the normal number of chromosomes . However , before they are separated , the pairs swap lengths of DNA via recombination events . These can involve exchanging large chunks of the chromosomes: this is called a ‘crossover’ . Alternatively , short stretches of one chromosome can be replaced by the corresponding region from the other in the pair . When these ‘non-crossovers’ cause a change in the DNA sequence they are known as gene conversions . Long-standing questions in the field of plant biology include: how common are gene conversions ? How much DNA is typically exchanged ? And where in the chromosomes do these events happen most ? Now , Wijnker et al . have addressed these questions by focusing on the accurate detection of recombination events , with a special emphasis on gene conversions , in the plant biologist’s favourite species: Arabidopsis . Searching for recombination events is a challenge because , when piecing together an entire genome from lots of shorter stretches of DNA—typically called ‘reads’ , it is easy to misplace some of the pieces . However , meticulous examination of these short DNA reads allowed Wijnker et al . to reliably identify gene conversions on a genome-wide scale . In Arabidopsis , gene conversion appears to be unexpectedly rare—with approximately one gene conversion detected per 140–240 non-crossovers . Recombination tends to occur in regions of the chromosomes where the DNA is only loosely packaged , is not heavily modified by the process of ‘DNA methylation’ , and also near the start of genes . Furthermore , two specific sequences of DNA bases were identified that marked ‘hot spots’ in the chromosomes , where recombination happens more frequently . Wijnker et al . suggest that the low number of gene conversions detected indicates that non-crossovers tend to exchange very short stretches of DNA . However , future research may point to additional mechanisms that explain the low incidence of gene conversion in Arabidopsis ."," In plants, when sperm cells form, they go through a process called meiosis where DNA is shuffled between chromosomes. This process involves both crossing over and gene conversion events that can lead to new variations in the plant's genes. Scientists have studied these processes using different methods such as sequencing or mapping techniques. However, there may be some limitations to these approaches. For example, it can be difficult to distinguish between crossing over events and other types of similar events like gene conversations. Therefore, scientists used a combination of sequencing data from hybrid plants and computer programs to identify and analyze these events more accurately. They found that crossing over tends to occur in areas of the genome that do not contain methylation marks on DNA, especially near certain parts of genes called promotors. Additionally, they identified one specific type of gene conversation event that was linked to a particular transposable element in the genomic region. These findings provide important insights into how plants evolve over time and adapt to changing environments. Further studies could help us better understand the role of these events in plant development and disease resistance. By gaining a deeper understanding of these processes, researchers may be able to develop strategies to improve crop yields and enhance plant resilience to environmental stressors."
"Mastering a new movement requires practice . Intensive and repetitive training is essential for musicians , athletes , or surgeons . It is also important for people undergoing rehabilitation to help them regain normal movements after an illness or injury . Although practice is said to make perfect , there comes the point when it also causes physical fatigue . Fatigue can impair how well a person performs a movement , but its effects on learning a task are less clear . Now , Branscheidt et al . show that being physically fatigued interferes with learning a new movement skill . In the experiments , volunteers were divided in two groups: the first group had to learn a new motor skill after their hand muscles were physically fatigued , the second group learned the same task without being worn out . The fatigued volunteers had a harder time learning a new motor task both on the day of the task and on the following days , even after they had recovered from the fatigue . The same experiment was repeated , but instead of learning a motor task , the volunteers were asked to learn a sequence of keystrokes . The volunteers in both groups learned this new thinking task easily . This suggests that learning new thinking tasks is not affected by physical fatigue . Branscheidt et al . also disrupted memory formation in part of the brain that controls movement after volunteers finished learning the motor task using a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . This eliminated the motor learning deficit in the fatigued group . This may suggest that memories formed after fatigue may impair later motor learning and that physical training or rehabilitation that pushes people to work past fatigue may be counterproductive . Further study of these processes may help to develop better training regimens and rehabilitation methods ."," Physical exhaustion (fatigue) has been shown to negatively affect our ability to learn new things. For example, if you have ever tried to study something right before your workout, you might have noticed that you don't retain much of what you learned afterwards. Researchers have discovered that this is because when we feel tired from exercising, our brains cannot process new information effectively. Even though we may still be able to do the tasks at hand, the quality of our performance will decrease over time. To make matters worse, this effect persists even when we are no longer feeling tired. However, there are ways to counteract these negative effects. By stimulating certain parts of the brain during exercise, researchers were able to improve participants’ retention of knowledge despite their initial state of fatiguedness. These findings suggest that perhaps taking breaks between studying and working out could help us better understand and remember new concepts. It also highlights the importance of considering one's mental state when engaging in both workouts and educational activities. Overall, this study sheds light on how fatigue impacts our cognitive abilities and provides practical tips on how to mitigate some of these effects. As such, next time you decide to hit the books, consider giving yourself ample rest first so that you can get the most out of your studies!"
"Healthy cells can typically repair damage to their DNA with high accuracy , keeping their genetic code intact . In contrast , cancer cells often lose this ability . Inaccurate repair leads to more frequent DNA mutations , which can make a tumor more aggressive . However , DNA repair-deficient tumors can be targeted with cancer therapies , such as PARP inhibitors , which kill cells that do not have working DNA repair mechanisms . PARP inhibitors show great promise clinically , but unfortunately some tumor cells can become resistant to these treatments over time . Recent work has shown that resistance to PARP inhibitors is often caused by further alternations to DNA repair machineries . Being able to visualize DNA repair in living cells is crucial to understanding this process and to find ways to improve cancer treatments . Previous studies have used repetitive DNA sequences called Lac operators ( LacO ) to visualize the dynamic behavior of DNA in live cells . Leland et al . have now adapted this system to watch individual DNA repair events in living yeast cells under the microscope . Their experiments reveal that when cells lose a single protein called Rev7 , an early phase of DNA repair becomes hyperactive . Leland et al . traced the cause of this hyperactivity to an enzyme in the RecQ helicase family . A RecQ helicase becoming hyperactive in cells lacking Rev7 could explain how some cancer cells become resistant to PARP inhibitor treatments . This information could help fine-tune future approaches to treating cancer . For example , using an inhibitor of RecQ helicase alongside PARP inhibitors may help block this type of resistance from developing in the first place . As well as potentially paving the way for better cancer treatments , this method of visualization could improve scientists’ understanding of the basic processes of DNA repair ."," Poly(ADP) Ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor drugs work on tumor cells that have broken DNA strands which cannot be fixed properly because they lack a way to copy from another similar piece of DNA. To fix these problems, cells need to cut off some pieces of the damaged DNA so it can be repaired later using other pieces of DNA as examples. This cutting process is called “resection”. Cells that use too much resection will not survive when treated with PARP inhibitor drug treatment. Some proteins called 59BP1 and REV7 help keep resection under control. We used tiny cameras to watch how well different types of protein were working together to do their jobs. When we took away either 40BP1 alone or REV6 alone, we saw more resection than normal. So, if someone has too little of these proteins, then their cells may become resistant to PARP drugs. Our findings show us one way that cells might resist PARP drug treatments. It could happen if the cell's resection machinery was changed to rely less on certain proteins and more on others. If doctors knew about these changes happening inside patients' bodies, they would know better what kinds of tests to give them to see whether they should switch to a different kind of medicine."
"Individuals of the same species have similar , but generally not identical , DNA sequences . This ‘genetic variation’ is due to random changes in the DNA—known as mutations—that occur among individuals . These mutations may be passed on to these individuals' offspring , who in turn pass them on to their descendants . Some of these mutations may have a positive or negative effect on the ability of the organisms to survive and reproduce , but others may have no effect at all . The process by which an embryo forms ( which is called embryogenesis ) follows a precisely controlled series of events . Within the same species , there is genetic variation in the DNA that programs embryogenesis , but it is not clear what effect this variation has on how the embryo develops . Here , Paaby et al . adapted a genetics technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study how genetic variation affects the development of a roundworm known as Caenorhabditis elegans . The experiments show that populations of worms harbor a lot of genetic variation that affects how they tolerate the loss of an important gene . One by one , Paaby et al . interrupted the activity of specific genes that embryos need in order to develop . How this affected the embryo , and whether or not it was able to survive , was due in large part to the naturally-occurring genetic variation in other genes in these worms . Paaby et al . 's findings serve as a reminder that the effect of a mutation depends on other DNA sequences in the organism . In humans , for example , a gene that causes a genetic disease may produce severe symptoms in one patient but mild symptoms in another . Future experiments will reveal the details of how genetic variation affects embryogenesis , which may also provide new insights into how complex processes in animals evolve over time ."," Embryos develop into larvae through a highly regulated process called embryo development. This process is different between each organism on earth. However, it still follows some basic rules across all living things. Scientists wanted to know if these rules change over time as new mutations occur within a population. They also wanted to see whether there was any genetic variation that could affect this process without causing major defects when they removed genes from the genome. To do so, they studied nematode worms that had been bred naturally in the environment. These worms already contained thousands of differences compared to lab strains. Then, they introduced additional changes to the genomic sequence using RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi allows them to turn off specific genes and observe their phenotype. By doing so, scientists found that most of the genetic variations did not cause significant changes to embryonics development. However; they discovered that together, these small variations could significantly alter the outcome of embrio development. In other words, even though most individual variations did nothing by themselves, they could work together to produce large effects. This finding suggests that evolutionary processes might be able to shape traits by changing the way that multiple small variations interact with one another."
"The chemical reactions that occur within a living organism are collectively referred to as its metabolism . Many metabolic reactions produce byproducts that will poison the cells if they are not dealt with: fermenting bacteria , for example , release harmful organic acids and alcohols . How the bacteria respond to these toxins has been most studied at the level of entire microbial populations , meaning the activities of individual cells are effectively “averaged” together . Yet , even two bacteria with the same genes and living in the same environment can behave in different ways . This raises the question: do bacterial populations specialize into distinct subpopulations that play distinct roles when dealing with metabolic products , or do all cells in the community act in unison ? Rosenthal et al . set out to answer this question for a community of Bacillus subtilis , a bacterium that is commonly studied in the laboratory and used for the industrial production of enzymes . The analysis focused on genes involved in fundamental metabolic processes , known as the TCA cycle , which the bacteria use to generate energy and build biomass . The experiments revealed that , even when all the cells are genetically identical , different Bacillus subtilis cells do indeed specialize into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates . Time-lapse movies of bacteria that made fluorescent markers of different colors whenever certain metabolic genes became active showed cells switching different colors on and off , indicating that they switch between metabolic subpopulations . Further biochemical studies and measures of gene activity revealed that the different subpopulations produce and release distinct metabolic products , including toxic byproducts . Notably , the release of these metabolites by one subpopulation appeared to activate other subpopulations within the community . This example of cells specializing into unique interacting metabolic subpopulations provides insight into several fundamental issues in microbiology and beyond . It is relevant to evolutionary biologists , since the fact that fractions of the population can switch in and out of a metabolic state , instead of evolving into several inflexible specialists , may provide an evolutionary advantage in fluctuating natural environments by reducing the risk of extinction . It also has implications for industrial fermentation processes and metabolic engineering , and may help biotechnologists design more efficient ways to harness bacterial metabolism to produce useful products ."," Scientists have found that bacteria living together in groups called colonies often take on specific roles or jobs to help them survive better as a group. For example, some members might make food for others to eat while other members might protect against enemies. This kind of division of labor helps each member do their job more efficiently. In this study, scientists looked at a type of bacteria called Bacilleus Subtillis that lives by itself or in groups. They discovered that even when these bacteria live alone, they still like to split up and take on different tasks. Some produce acidic foods (like vinegar) while others produce neutral foods (that don't affect the pH). These two types of bacteria then share the resources produced by both types so they can all grow faster. By dividing up the work, these single cells act like a team! And just like teams need different people to function well, individual cells also benefit from splitting up the tasks. So next time you feel lonely remember that even if you're all by yourself, you can still find ways to work together with your surroundings to achieve great things! 🤝🌎 #BacteriaAreAwesome. #TeamworkMakesTheDreamWork."
"Before a cell can divide to form two new cells , it must duplicate its DNA to ensure the newly formed cells have the same genetic information as the original . This genetic material is made up of two single strands of DNA that are paired to form a double-stranded helix . Certain groups of proteins separate these two DNA strands to form a two-pronged structure known as a ‘replication fork’ . This occurs at different points along the length of the DNA double helix . Groups of proteins then travel down the DNA strands , separating them as they go , and using them as templates for making copies of the DNA . DNA replication is finally completed when different replication forks meet and merge . This process does not always occur smoothly because some regions of DNA contain obstacles that impede the movement of the replication machinery . In most cases , the replication proteins briefly stall and then restart . However , occasionally the machinery can fall off the DNA; this event is known as a ‘replication fork collapse’ . Nguyen et al . have now used a method called time-lapse microscopy to visualise this process inside a species of yeast—called fission yeast—as it occurs in real time . Fission yeast's genetic material is known to contain a specific site that blocks the replication machinery . Nguyen et al . found that a protein called Rad52 arrives at this specific site within 10 minutes of a replication fork being blocked . This protein enables recovery of the replication fork within an hour via a process known as ‘DNA recombination’ . Nguyen et al . also unexpectedly found that the restarted fork is susceptible to further collapse . It is known from previous work that the mechanisms that repair broken DNA and rescue replication forks can also introduce errors into the DNA . This implies that if fork collapse occurs frequently , it can lead to the introduction of numerous errors that can be detrimental to cells . Thus , the rescue of fork collapse is like a double-edged sword; it is required for replication to proceed , but can lead to genetic changes inside cells . The failure to faithfully replicate genetic material drives the development of diseases such as cancer . Therefore , insights gained from Nguyen et al . 's findings may provide an improved understanding of how genetic alterations occur in both normal and cancerous cells ."," Replication fork obstacles can prevent cells from completing their DNA copy process. To fix this problem, cells have developed ways to repair these obstacles using different methods. One way is called recombining, or recombition, where two pieces of DNA are joined together to form one piece again. This method can be used quickly, but sometimes leads to mistakes being made in the copied DNA. These mistakes can lead to problems later on when the cell tries to divide into two copies. In some cases, however, recombion may not be needed because there is enough time left before division happens. It seems like the best thing to do would be to wait until the next round of copying so that more time is available to finish the job without making any mistakes. However, waiting too long could also cause other problems such as running out of time to make copies before the cell divides anyway. So, it's important for cells to know how much time they have left before dividing and decide whether to wait or start recombinating right away. By studying how fast recombions happen after an obstacle blocks the copying process, scientists can learn more about how cells deal with these kinds of problems. They might also find new ways to help treat diseases caused by problems with DNA copying."
"The genetic information inside our cells is stored in the form of chromosomes , which are carefully packaged strands of DNA . Most human cells contain a pair of each chromosome: one inherited from the mother and another from the father . Typically , when a human cell divides , it duplicates all of its chromosomes and then places one copy of each into the two new cells . However , a different process—known as ‘meiosis’—occurs when a human cell divides to make the cells involved in sexual reproduction ( i . e . , egg cells in females and sperm cells in males ) . First , the cell duplicates all of its chromosomes as before , but then it pairs the chromosomes originally from the mother with the equivalent chromosomes from the father . These paired chromosomes then swap sections of DNA . Next , the cell divides , and the resulting cells divide again; this produces four new cells that each contain a single , unique copy of every chromosome . In the process of swapping sections of DNA between chromosomes , the DNA molecule inside the chromosome is broken and different sections of DNA are then joined together . This can occur by one of two methods: ‘crossover events’ that produce a final chromosome made up of long sequences from each of the contributing chromosomes; and ‘non-crossover events’ , where only a small section of DNA is swapped between the chromosomes . Research has tended to focus on DNA breaks and crossover events . Now , Williams et al . have looked at the genetic sequences transmitted by both parents to 49 humans—revealing information about a total of 98 meioses—and scoured them for evidence of non-crossover events . In addition to finding 103 sites where these events occurred , Williams et al . discovered that non-crossover events are more frequent around sites where crossover events also have a higher frequency . This suggests that the mechanism that initiates non-crossover events is shared with crossovers , and that non-crossover events primarily occur during meiosis . Unexpectedly , in some areas non-crossover events were found close to each other in ‘clusters’ , which had not previously been seen in humans . Non-crossover events will only produce an observable change if the chromosomes involved have differences in the sequence of the DNA section that is swapped between them . The number of such variable genetic positions that non-crossover events affect in a generation is roughly the same number as the number of newly generated random mutations to the DNA sequence in a generation . Examining the DNA sequences transferred during non-crossover events also shows that two different types of DNA bases ( cytosine and guanine ) are more likely to be transmitted by a non-crossover event than are the other two bases ( adenine and thymine ) . This bias indicates that non-crossover events are an important factor in driving genome evolution . In the future , sequencing the entire genome—the total genetic material—of many different people could provide further insights into non-crossover events in humans ."," Scientists have found evidence of something called “non-cross over” gene conversion happening during human reproduction. This process involves copying DNA from one part of a chromosome onto another nearby section of the same chromosomes. It happens more often than expected when there are two different versions of a particular piece of DNA on both copies of a pair of chromosomal pairs. These changes only happen during gamete formation, meaning they don’t affect the parent generation but will be passed down through future generations. They also seem to occur randomly rather than being inherited directly from parents. Interestingly, these changes tend to favor certain types of genetic material over others. Finally, scientists discovered that sometimes several of these changes can happen very closely together, almost like they are all triggered by some unknown event. Overall, this finding provides new insights into how genes change over time and could help us better understand why certain diseases run in families or why people respond differently to medications based on their genetic makeup. However, it remains unclear exactly what causes these changes to occur and whether they play any role in causing disease. Further research is needed to answer these questions and determine if this newly discovered type of gene conversion might be useful as a tool for treating certain conditions. In short, scientists have made an exciting discovery related to how genes work and pass down traits from one generation to the next."
"DNA in human and other animal cells is organised into structures called chromosomes . One of the most dangerous types of DNA damage is a double-strand break , where both strands of the DNA helix are broken in the same place . If this damage is not repaired it can be serious enough to kill the cell . If the DNA is repaired badly , part of one chromosome can become attached to another – a defect known as a chromosome translocation . Fortunately , cells are equipped with machineries that can recognise and fix these breaks . One of these processes is known as “non-homologous end joining” and it involves a set of proteins including two known as XRCC4 and XLF . These proteins work like a bandage , holding together the broken DNA until it is repaired . Both proteins have long tails , but the role of these structures was not clear . During DNA repair , the cell chemically modifies the tails of these proteins by a process called phosphorylation . However , previous studies have found that it is possible to prevent the modification of the tail of one of the proteins , or even remove the tail entirely , without affecting the repair process . Here , Normanno et al . investigated the effect of blocking the modification of the tails of both proteins at the same time . For the experiments , the tails were both altered in various places to either block or mimic the phosphorylation that normally occurs during DNA repair . Mimicking the phosphorylation of both tails affected the ability of XRCC4 and XLF to stay attached to the DNA , suggesting that the phosphorylation helps these proteins to detach from the DNA once the repair is complete . Furthermore , in human embryonic kidney cells the altered proteins were less able to repair DNA damage in response to a drug that causes double-strand breaks . These findings improve our understanding of how cells repair their DNA to maintain a complete set of genetic information . Defects in DNA repair are linked to conditions where the brain does not develop properly , whilst some cancer therapies deliberately inflict double-strand breaks to kill cancer cells . In the future , these findings may lead to improvements in radiotherapy and other treatments for human diseases ."," Scientists have found that when cells get damaged, they need to fix it quickly. To do so, they use proteins called XRRC4 and LIG3. However, these proteins don't work well together unless another protein named XLIF is added. This happens because XLFI can help bring XRCRC4 and LI3 closer together. But sometimes, other things happen that make XLFF not work properly. For example, some chemicals can change how XLFR works. When scientists changed certain parts of XLRF, it made XRCS4 and LiG3 work better together even though there was still something wrong with XLFC. This means that changing just one part of XLCFF could actually improve how well the whole system works! This suggests that changing only one small part of a protein might be able to make the entire protein work better at fixing damaged cells. It will be important to see if this idea turns out to be true in living cells. If it does, then maybe doctors could find ways to change just one small thing inside people's bodies to help them heal from injuries faster. That would be amazing! Science is always looking for new ways to help people get better after getting hurt. And now, thanks to this study, we know that changing one tiny piece of a special kind of protein might someday be enough to make someone feel better."
"Cancer develops when cells in the body mutate in ways that allow them to rapidly grow and divide . To protect cells from becoming cancerous , various molecules act like guardians to prevent cells from dividing when their DNA is damaged , or if they are short of energy . Other guardian molecules monitor the DNA copying process to ensure that the newly-made DNA is as identical as possible to the original DNA template . A protein called p21 belongs to the first group of guardian molecules: DNA damage triggers the production of p21 , which prevents the cell from copying its DNA . This role relies on a section of the protein called the CDK binding domain . Cells that have already started to copy their genetic material also have low levels of p21 . Mansilla et al . used human cells to investigate whether p21 is also involved in the process of copying DNA . The experiments show that the low levels of p21 act to increase the speed at which the DNA is copied . This activity helps to ensure that all of the cell’s DNA is copied within the time available , including sections of DNA that are harder to copy because they are more fragile and prone to damage . This newly identified role does not involve the CDK binding domain , but instead requires a different section of the p21 protein known as the PCNA interacting region . Mansilla et al . propose that p21 plays a dual role in protecting us from developing cancer . The PCNA interacting region is also found in other proteins that are involved in copying DNA . Therefore , a future challenge is to find out how these proteins interact with each other to ensure that cells accurately copy their DNA in a timely fashion ."," In this study, researchers found that even when there are no problems or damage to DNA, a protein called p27 can help keep our DNA stable. They also discovered that another protein called polymerases kappa helps cause these issues. This means that having enough of the p28 protein can help protect against certain types of genetic mutations. These findings could be important for understanding how some diseases develop and may lead to new ways to treat them.

"Estimates suggest that more than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson’s disease . This condition , which is incurable , is characterised by the death of brain cells leading to tremors and loss of motor control . So far scientists have been able to link mutations in nearly 20 different genes to Parkinson’s disease . This includes the gene that codes for an enzyme called PINK1 . Mutations that affect PINK1 are often seen in people with early-onset Parkinson’s disease and cases that are inherited through families . Changes to PINK1 affects the ability of cells to keep producing energy . Without enough energy to power biochemical processes , affected cells will eventually die . Understanding why PINK1 has this effect and how to prevent it could be helpful in treating Parkinson’s disease . One way to understand the role of PINK1 is to study the three-dimensional structure of the protein to examine how it interacts with other molecules . The PINK1 protein from the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is easier to produce than human PINK1; this makes it easier to study its structure in the laboratory . Using flour beetle PINK1 and a technique called X-ray crystallography , Kumar , Tamjar , Waddell et al . made a detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of the PINK1 protein . This revealed new details of the structure including a region at one end called the “C-terminal extension” , which is involved in PINK1’s enzyme activities . The structure also highlighted the purposes of two loop regions , one that controls PINK1 activity and one that affects its interactions with other proteins . Further examination of some of these features showed that they are also part of human PINK1 proteins . Using this new protein structure , Kumar et al . went on to examine 20 mutations that are found in patients with Parkinson’s disease and have been able to show the effect that these changes have on PINK1 at a molecular level . It may now be possible to begin designing drugs to prevent or reverse these changes , which could lead to new treatments for Parkinson’s disease ."," Scientists have found out what part of the gene called PINK 1 causes problems when it has certain kinds of changes or ""mutations"" in people who have Parkinson’s disease. They did this by looking very closely at the shape of the PINK gene using special tools like X-ray beams. This helped them figure out exactly where different parts of the protein made by the PIN 1 gene fit together to make the whole protein work properly. Then they looked more carefully at one particular kind of change in the PING 1 protein that was causing problems in some patients with Parkinson ’ s disease. By studying the shape and position of this changed part of PING I, they were able to find out why these changes caused problems. Finally, they used their knowledge about the shape, position, and way things worked inside cells to come up with ideas for new medicines that might help treat Parkinson ‘ s disease better than current treatments do. These medicines could work by helping the PICK 1 proteins work right again even if they had been changed by illnesses. It would take scientists many years of doing experiments and trying different ways to make these drugs before any of them actually became available to use. But researchers hope that finding out more about the PARK 1 genes will lead to new ways to prevent or treat Parkison’s diseases someday."
"Dengue fever is an infectious tropical disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes carrying dengue virus . Almost half of the world’s population lives in dengue-plagued regions and it is estimated that between 50 and 100 million people are infected annually . However , there is no effective vaccine and researchers have only a limited understanding of the mechanisms behind the disease . While most infected individuals experience fever , headache , muscle and joint pain , and a skin rash , a small percentage go on to develop a life-threatening condition known as dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) . This is marked by internal bleeding , and by the leakage of water and salts from blood vessels ( vascular leakage ) . At present , it is difficult to tell which patients will develop this complication , making it hard to tailor treatment appropriately . Here , St John et al . reveal that the vascular leakage that occurs in DHF is triggered by mast cells , which line blood vessels and regulate their permeability through the release of molecules such as histamines and leukotrienes . They also found that mice deficient in mast cells did not show dengue-induced vascular leakage , and that wild-type animals treated with drugs that block the actions of proteins produced by these cells , showed less vascular leakage than controls . Moreover , levels of an enzyme called chymase , another mast cell product , are higher in human patients with DHF than in those with dengue fever . Since chymase release occurs early in infection , tests for the presence of this enzyme could be used to predict which patients are likely to develop DHF . The work of St John et al . suggests new lines of inquiry into the mechanisms that lead some individuals infected with dengue fever to develop DHF , and indicates that drugs that target mast cells could offer an effective treatment ."," Dengue Fever (DF) is caused by a type of virus called Dengues Viruses (DENV). This virus is transmitted through mosquitos. When people get DF, they may experience symptoms such as high temperature, rash, joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, bleeding gums, etc. Some patients also develop severe forms of DF known as Denguing Hemorrhgic Fevers (DHF), which can lead to death. Scientists have found out that when people get infected with DENV, it activates special immune cells called “mast cells” (MCs). These MCs release certain chemicals into the bloodstream that increase how much fluid leaks from blood vessels into surrounding tissues. To stop this effect, scientists used medicines that help stabilize MCs or blocked one specific chemical made by MCs called Leukotreine B4 Receptor Antagonist (LTB4RA). They found that both treatments stopped the extra fluid loss and improved how well the blood clotted. Furthermore, scientists looked at medical records of 108 patients who had been treated for DF. They found out those patients whose MCs were more active had higher chances of getting worse form of DV than others. Finally, scientists discovered another chemical released by MC called Chymase. They showed that measuring its level in patient’s blood could tell them if the person has mild or severe form of the disease. Based on all these results, scientists suggest that treating DF patients with MC stabilizers early after infection might improve their condition and reduce the risk of developing severe form."
"Alexander disease is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative condition . It is caused by mutations in a gene that is crucial for the structure of astrocytes , a type of brain cell whose role is to support neurons . The gene codes for a protein called GFAP , which is made almost exclusively in astrocytes . In Alexander disease , mutated versions of the gene make GFAP collect in disordered clumps or aggregates , which interfere with the astrocytes’ normal activities . All Alexander disease patients develop GFAP aggregates , but the type of mutation they have in the gene for GFAP does not predict how their illness will progress . The age of onset of disease , for example , can vary between less than one year old to more than 70 years old . Battaglia et al . sought to understand how GFAP aggregates form in the cells of Alexander disease patients . One way that GFAP can be altered in the cell is by a process called phosphorylation . Enzymes called kinases add phosphate groups to GFAP , which can regulate the protein’s activity , stability and interactions with other proteins . Battaglia et al . found high levels of phosphorylation at one specific site in the GFAP protein in people who had very early onset of Alexander disease . This phosphorylation was not related to any particular mutation in the gene for GFAP . An added phosphate group at this location in the protein made GFAP more likely to be broken into two pieces by an enzyme called caspase-6 . One of the breakdown products is already known to play a role in aggregation . Young patients with Alexander disease had high levels of GFAP breakdown products and caspase-6 . The phosphorylated protein and this enzyme were found to accumulate in astrocyte aggregates . The findings provide a basis for investigating new strategies to treat Alexander disease that target phosphorylation – as removing or preventing the addition of phosphate groups can be done with drugs . But before exploring how to do this , it will be necessary to find out which enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating GFAP at this particular position . These studies may also give a broader understanding of other GFAP-like proteins ( called intermediate filament proteins ) , which are involved in over 70 human diseases ."," Scientists have found a way to tell apart two types of Alexander Disease (AxD) based on how the main protein in the body, called Glial Fibrillar Acid Protein or GFAP, gets changed. In one type of AxD, scientists found that GFAP got changed at position number 13, making it more likely that people with this kind of AVD would die younger than those whose GFAP did not get changed at that spot. They also saw that when GFAP was changed at spot number 274, it made it easier for another protein called Caspase 6 to cut up GFAP into smaller pieces. This cutting up happened most often in babies with AxD. These discoveries could help doctors better understand why some people with AVD live longer or shorter lives. It might even be possible to use these changes as a way of telling whether someone has one type or the other type of this rare genetic condition. However, more studies need to be done before we know if these things will really work. Overall, this study shows us that there may be ways to find out what kind of Alexander's Disease a person has, so that we can make predictions about their life expectancy. That could be helpful for families trying to plan ahead for their loved ones."
"Diseases spread by mosquito bites – like malaria , dengue and Zika – kill over half a million people each year . Many of these diseases have no cure , and those that do often face the problem of drug resistance . As such , the most effective way to control these diseases is to reduce the number of mosquitoes in the affected area . Yet , this kind of control strategy relies on knowing which species of mosquito that spread diseases to humans and where they are found . Most current methods to monitor mosquitoes are laborious , and need expensive equipment and highly trained people . This makes them less suitable for resource-poor areas , which typically have the highest levels of mosquito-borne diseases . However , scientists have known for many decades that one can identify species of mosquito by the pitch of sound they make when they fly . The challenge was to find instruments that could record these sounds clearly enough to measure the pitch , but that were still cheap and sturdy enough to use in mosquito-infested environments . Mukundarajan et al . now report that the microphones in ordinary mobile phones are sensitive enough to accurately record the whining buzz of a mosquito , even in the presence of background noise . First , techniques were developed that allow anybody to record mosquitoes on virtually any mobile phone model – including smartphones and basic flip-phones . Next , the sounds of 20 species of mosquito that spread diseases to humans were recorded – more than in any previous study . When other recordings made using various phones were compared to this collection of sounds , the correct species was automatically identified for two thirds of the recordings . This meant that , together with volunteers who were trained for 15 minutes , Mukundarajan et al . could use mobile phone recordings to map mosquito species inside a National Park in California and a village in Madagascar more efficiently than with any conventional method . There are over five billion mobile phones in use today . Even a small percentage of mobile users recording mosquito sounds could thus provide a tremendous amount of data . As more and more people contribute recordings , Mukundarajan et al . hope to be able to make real-time global maps of mosquito distributions . These could then be used to design better strategies to control mosquitoes and combat mosquito-borne diseases ."," Mosquito population monitoring is essential for controlling mosquitos and preventing disease outbreaks caused by mosquitol-borne illnesses such as malaria or dengue fever. Currently, this requires trained experts who use expensive equipment to capture and identify mosquitsos based on their physical characteristics. However, these methods can be slow and laborious. In this study, researchers used smartphones equipped with microphones to detect and classify different types of mosqutios based on the unique sound they make when flying. This method was found to be accurate and could be used by anyone with minimal training. It also allows for real-time tracking of mosquisito populations over large geographic areas without requiring any specialized equipment. Overall, this approach has great potential to improve mosquitoc surveillance efforts around the world. By using smartphone technology, it becomes much easier and cheaper to monitor mosquitis populations, which will help reduce the spread of mosquetoborne diseases. Additionally, this method can provide valuable insights into the behavior and ecology of different mosquisto species, allowing us to better understand how to effectively control them. Finally, this technique may also have applications beyond mosquiotsurveillance, such as monitoring other insects that emit distinctive sounds during flight."
"The immune system protects against disease by recognizing invading pathogens , such as bacteria and viruses , and launching various responses to eliminate them . In vertebrates , such as mice and humans , this response often involves both an ‘innate’ and an ‘adaptive’ component . The innate immune response is fast but it is not targeted at the specific pathogen that needs to be eliminated . The adaptive immune response is slower , but it is also stronger and tailored to combat the specific pathogen that is attacking the host . In general , both the innate and adaptive immune responses work together to combat the infection . The innate immune system is activated when host cells are damaged or stressed , or when ‘foreign’ molecules that are tell-tale signs of microbes and pathogens are detected . It enlists white blood cells that engulf and digest infected host cells or pathogens , and then display the digested fragments via proteins called major histocompatibility complexes . The adaptive immune response relies on other white blood cells called B cells ( which make antibodies ) and T cells ( which carry out a variety of roles ) . Each T cell will respond to a very specific fragment of protein displayed by a major histocompatibility complex . Although a bacteria or virus can generate thousands of protein fragments , only a select few will stimulate an immune response . This phenomenon is known as immunodominance . As T cells mature in the thymus—a specialized organ located in the chest—they undergo both positive and negative selection . To survive positive selection , the T cells must be able to recognize fragments from the host’s own proteins . Negative selection removes T cells that interact too strongly with these ‘self-peptides’ because such interactions will cause the T cells to destroy the host’s tissues and cause auto-immune diseases . Positive selection is thought to have an important role in immunodominance because it shapes the population of T cells released from the thymus , but it has been difficult to test this hypothesis . Now Lo et al . have explored this question by engineering transgenic mice in which gp250—a self peptide that positively selects T cells that respond to a foreign protein called MCC—was the only self peptide to be presented during positive selection . Subsequent experiments showed that the mature T cells released by the thymus increased the fraction of T cells that were capable of responding to the dominant fraction of possible MCC fragments . By establishing a clear connection between positive selection and immunodominance , the work of Lo et al . could assist the development of more effective vaccines ."," A recent study found that certain types of immune cells called T cells recognize different parts of proteins than other T cells do when they respond to viruses or bacteria. This happens because each type of T cell recognizes a slightly different part of the protein. Scientists have been trying to understand why some kinds of T cells seem to be more common than others. They think this might happen because there are many ways that T cells could react to a particular virus or bacterium, so if one way of doing it gets used up responding to the infection, another way has to step in to handle things. To test their idea, scientists made mice that would only make one kind of T lymphocyte (a type of immune cell) instead of all the usual ones. These special mice were infected with a virus that usually causes lots of different kinds of immune responses. When the researchers looked at which kinds of these new T cells responded first, they saw that the ones that recognized the same part of a protein that most of the normal T cells would recognize were always among the first to show up. So, the answer to the question about why some T cells tend to be much more common is that those kinds of cells may get picked first when the body responds to an infection."
"The brain has a remarkable ability to adapt to changes in circumstances . But what happens to the brain when it loses a key source of input , for example , following the amputation of a limb ? A region of the brain known as primary somatosensory cortex processes sensory inputs from all over the body . The more sensitive an area of the body is , the more fine-grained its representation is in the cortex . For example , the hand is represented with a highly detailed map , with each finger represented seperately . The brain is thought to require ongoing sensory signals from the body to maintain these detailed representations in the cortex . Indeed , textbooks typically state that the brain will ‘overwrite’ its representation of a body part if input from that area no longer arrives . According to this view , people who have lost a hand should show little or no activity in the area of primary somatosensory cortex that used to represent it . However , many people who have had a limb amputated continue to experience vivid sensations of the missing limb long after its loss . When asked to move their so-called ‘phantom’ limb , these individuals report being able to feel the movement . Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . now show , using advanced imaging techniques , that the brains of individuals with phantom hands continue to represent the missing hand several decades after its loss . Indeed , asking the subjects to move individual fingers of their phantom hand activates fine-grained representations of those fingers , similar to those seen in two-handed controls . By showing that the brain ‘remembers’ an amputated hand , Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . demonstrate that ongoing sensory input is not required to maintain representations of the body in somatosensory cortex . This , in turn , offers new hope for developing prosthetic limbs that are under direct brain control . If the brain continues to represent individual fingers many years after their loss , it should be possible to exploit those pathways to achieve intuitive fine-grained control of artificial fingers ."," This study looked at how the brain represents the hands of people who have had their arms removed (amputee). It was found that the part of the brain responsible for feeling touch from the hands still has an organized map of each finger, even if it hasn't felt anything in many years. These findings suggest that the organization of this part of brain does not change much over time, even without regular sensation. They also raise the possibility that prosthetic limbs might use these areas of the brains to better understand what the person wants to do with the artificial limb. This would allow them to make movements more natural and precise. Overall, this study provides important insights into how the human brain organizes itself based on past experiences. Understanding these principles can help us develop technology that works more naturally with the way our brains work. This will lead to improved prostheses and other assistive devices that feel more like they are a real part of our bodies. It may also help us learn more about how different parts of the body interact with each other when we move or sense things around us. Further studies using advanced imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)  or magnetoencephalography (MEG)  may provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena."
"Genes are turned into their protein products via two steps . The first , transcription , produces an intermediate RNA molecule or ‘transcript’; the second step , translation , turns the transcript into a protein . Most genes in mammals contain stretches of DNA called exons , which code for protein , interspersed with sequences called introns that do not . Therefore , a transcript must be ‘spliced’ before translation—the introns are removed and the exons joined . In some genes , certain exons can be optionally included or excluded from a transcript to produce different versions of the same protein that can often have very different functions . This is known as alternative splicing , and is essential for normal development . A large number of regulatory proteins control this process , many of which are only made in specific types of cells or tissues . Esrp1 and Esrp2 are two proteins that regulate alternative splicing in epithelial cells . These specialized cells form sheets that line most organs in the body and are found in the epidermis , the outermost layer of the skin . Although Esrp1 and Esrp2 have previously been studied in the laboratory using cultured cell lines , their roles have not been investigated in living animals . Bebee , Park et al . have now examined mice that are unable to produce one or both of these proteins . Mice that only lacked Esrp1 developed a cleft lip and palate . In mice that lacked both proteins , many organs failed to develop correctly and in some cases did not form at all . In the epidermis , the loss of Esrp1 and Esrp2 disrupted the splicing of the transcripts from genes that give epithelial cells many of their specialized characteristics , such as the ability to form sheets of cells with well formed junctions between them . This meant that epidermis that lacked Esrp1 and Esrp2 could not form a proper barrier layer , which is a crucial role of epithelia in skin as well as in other organs . In future , the mutant mice will be valuable for exploring how alternative splicing affects the development of epithelial cells and their properties ."," This study looked at how two genes called ESRP1 and ESRPP2 work together to control something called ""alternative splicings"" or ""AS"". Alternative splices are when different versions of one gene can be made by changing where certain parts of that gene's DNA get added into the final product. This process happens after the DNA has already been copied into RNA, before it gets turned back into proteins. It helps make sure that only specific kinds of proteins end up being made from each gene. In this case, these particular genes help decide what kind of proteinthe body makes so that things like embryos will grow properly. They found out that if you take away either ESRPR1 or ESRPS2, then there are problems during early stages of growth. When they took away both of them, even more serious problems happened! So, these genes are really important for making sure that we grow normally as babies. Also, other studies have shown that some diseases happen because of problems with alternative splications, so maybe finding ways to change how well these genes do their job could also help treat those diseases later on in life. That would be cool! But first, scientists need to learn much more about exactly how these genes work."
"Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and affects more than 40% of adults in the United States . People with obesity have a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease . Changes in diet and exercise can be difficult to follow and result in minimal weight loss that is rarely sustained overtime . In fact , in people with obesity , weight loss can lower the metabolism leading to increased weight gain . New drugs may help some individuals achieve 5 to 10% weight loss but have side effects that prevent long-term use . Previous studies in mice show that a hormone called Lipocalin-2 ( LCN2 ) suppresses appetite . It also reduces body weight and improves sugar metabolism in the animals . But whether this hormone has the same effects in humans or other primates is unclear . If it does , LCN2 might be a potential obesity treatment . Now , Petropoulou et al . show that LCN2 suppressed appetite in humans and monkeys . In human studies , LCN2 levels increased after a meal in individuals with normal weight or overweight , but not in individuals with obesity . Higher levels of LCN2 in a person’s blood were also associated with a feeling of reduced hunger . Using brain scans , Petropoulou et al . showed that LCN2 crossed the blood-brain barrier in monkeys and bound to the hypothalamus , the brain center regulating appetite and energy balance . LCN2 also bound to human and monkey hypothalamus tissue in laboratory experiments . When injected into monkeys , the hormone suppressed food intake and lowered body weight without toxic effects in short-term studies . The experiments lay the initial groundwork for testing whether LCN2 might be a useful treatment for obesity . More studies in animals will help scientists understand how LCN2 works , which patients might benefit , how it would be given to patients and for how long . Clinical trials would also be needed to verify whether it is an effective and safe treatment for obesity ."," This study found that a protein called lipocalin 2 (LCN 2) can help control how much people eat. When people ate meals, their bodies made more of this protein. More of it was also seen when people were given certain medicines. It was shown that LNC 2 could get into the brain from outside the body. Baboons, monkeys, and humans had similar results. Giving LCN 2 to monkeys helped them feel full faster after eating. Obese people did not have these same changes happen inside their bodies. This might mean they do not feel full like other people do. This protein might be important for helping treat obesities. However, more research needs to be done before we know if this protein will work well for treating obesites. Overall, this study showed that LCM 2 helps keep people from feeling hungry. It does this by making sure that enough energy gets into our brains so that we know when we should stop eating. This happens because LCN makes us feel full. People who make too little of this kind of protein might feel hungrier than others. They might want to eat more food even though they already ate plenty. This could explain why some people become fat. If scientists learn more about this protein, then maybe they can find ways to use it to help treat obese people."
"Mice are primarily nocturnal animals that rely on their whiskers to navigate dark underground burrows and winding corridors . When a whisker touches an object , cells called neurons at the base of the whiskers produce electrical signals that are relayed to other neurons in an area of the brain called the barrel cortex . However , it is not clear how information is encoded in these electrical signals , in part , because it is technically challenging to collect data about neuron activity and behavior while the mice move around . To overcome these difficulties , Sofroniew , Vlasov et al . used a touch-based ( or 'tactile' ) virtual reality system to study how mice navigate along corridors . The system simulated the contact the whiskers would have with the walls of a winding corridor . This was achieved by moving the walls with motors while holding the mouse still enough to be able to measure the activity of neurons in the barrel cortex and observe the behavior of the animal . The experiments show that the electrical signals in the barrel cortex encode information about motion as well as the distance between the mouse and the wall . For example , some neurons in the barrel cortex were only activated when a mouse was a particular distance from the walls . The experiments suggest that the barrel cortex processes signals received from several whiskers to build an overall picture of the locations and shapes of objects . Sofroniew , Vlasov et al . also used a technique called optogenetics to deliberately activate particular neurons in a manner that mimics their activity patterns during interactions with walls . In the absence of walls , the optogenetic stimuli guided the behavior of the mice so that they tracked along the paths of 'illusory' corridors . Together , these findings reveal the neural code in the barrel cortex that allows mice to navigate by touch ."," In this study, researchers used mice's whiskers as sensors while they navigated through a virtual environment. They found that the mouse brain uses different ways to represent where objects like walls are located. These representations occur at various levels of complexity and cannot be explained simply by looking at how each whisker interacts with an object. Instead, these representations emerge from complex interactions among many neurons in the brain. By understanding more about how the brain represents information, scientists might better understand what happens when people lose the ability to sense their surroundings. For example, some people have difficulty detecting changes in light or sound after certain types of injuries to the part of the brain responsible for vision or hearing. If scientists learn more about the brain's representation of touch, they might find new ways to help people regain sensation after nerve damage. Additionally, if doctors know which parts of the nervous system are most affected by diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's syndrome, they could develop targeted treatments to improve quality of life for patients. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how our brains process information from multiple sources simultaneously. It also highlights the importance of studying the brain in naturalistic settings rather than just focusing on its responses to isolated stimuli. Understanding how the human brain processes information will ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and therapies for neurological disorders."
"The immune system protects the body from dangerous microbes and removes damaged cells . However , in some cases , the immune system can malfunction and attack healthy tissues , which can lead to type-1 diabetes , multiple sclerosis , and other autoimmune diseases . Many of the current treatments for these disorders suppress the immune system , which can make the individuals more susceptible to infections . It may be possible to treat autoimmune diseases using small pieces of protein—called peptides—that are based on proteins found on the cells that the immune system attacks by mistake . This strategy would target the specific immune cells that are malfunctioning , but allow the rest of the immune system to continue to work as normal . Peptide-based therapies for autoimmune diseases are currently being tested in clinical trials , and although the results look promising , it is not known precisely how they work . McPherson et al . used mice that develop a disease similar to multiple sclerosis because some of their immune cells , known as effector T cells , attack a protein found in the mouse brain called MBP . The mice were treated with a peptide based on part of MBP , which prevented them from developing the autoimmune disease . The success of the peptide therapy depended on the T cells producing large amounts of a protein called PD-1 . This protein stops the T-cells from activating immune responses when they detect the MBP protein . The gene that makes PD-1 can have a methyl-tag—a chemical modification to DNA—which alters how much PD-1 is made in the T cells . When the gene has this methyl-tag , it can only be switched on for a short time to make a small amount of PD-1 , which helps to control the immune responses activated by the T cell . However , when the methyl-tag was removed as a result of the peptide therapy the gene could be switched on for much longer , so that much more PD-1 was produced . This work helps us to understand how peptide therapy works and should improve the chances of using this therapy to successfully treat patients with autoimmune diseases ."," Scientists have discovered that when certain types of cancer cells grow out of control, they produce special proteins called “PD-1” on their surface. These proteins help the cancer cells survive even though other parts of the body want them to die. To stop these cancer cells from growing, scientists developed a way to give our bodies a type of protein called “peptides.” Peptides are like little keys that can unlock specific doors on cells. In this case, the peptides were designed to fit into the doorways of the cancer’s cells so that the PD1 proteins could no longer attach to those doorways. However, there was one problem – some of the healthy cells in our bodies also had PD1 receptors on them! If the peptic key just opened up all of those door ways, it would make us sick because our healthy cells would be damaged too. So, scientists came up with another kind of peptile that blocked the PDl receptor on the surface of our healthy body cells. When they gave both kinds of pepts to mice with cancer, the cancer stopped growing and the mice got better. But how did this work? Scientists looked more closely at what happened inside the cells and found something called “epigenetics”. They found that giving the pepts changed the way the genetic code worked inside the cancerous cells. It made the cancer stop growing."
"Before humans invented agriculture and the first farmers appeared in southwestern Asia , other ancient foragers ( also known as hunter-gatherers ) in southeastern Europe had already developed a taste for consuming wild plants . There is evidence to suggest that these foragers were intensely gathering wild cereal grains before the arrival of agriculture . However , until now , the only place outside southwestern Asia this has been shown to have occurred is in Greece , and is dated around 20 , 000 years ago . In the past , researchers proposed that forager societies in the Balkans also consumed wild cereals before transitioning to agriculture . But this has been difficult to prove because plant foods are less likely to preserve than animal bones and teeth , making them harder to detect in prehistoric contexts . To overcome this , Cristiani et al . studied teeth from 60 individuals found in archaeological sites between Serbia and Romania , which are attributed to the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods . Food particles extracted from crusty deposits on the teeth ( called the dental calculus ) were found to contain structures typically found in plants . In addition , Cristiani et al . discovered similar plant food residues on ground stone tools which also contained traces of wear associated with the processing of wild cereals . These findings suggest that foragers in the central Balkans were already consuming certain species of wild cereal grains 11 , 500 years ago , before agriculture arrived in Europe . It is possible that sharing knowledge about plant resources may have helped introduce domesticated plant species in to this region as early as 6500 BC . This work challenges the deep-rooted idea that the diet of hunter-gatherers during the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods primarily consisted of animal proteins . In addition , it highlights the active role the eating habits of foragers might have played in introducing certain domesticated plant species that have become primary staples of our diet today ."," Scientists studied teeth and stones found at archaeological sites in Serbia and Romania to learn about what people ate during the Stone Age. They discovered that some people living around 10,000 years ago ate foods like wheat and barley, which are now grown as crops. These findings suggest that these early people may have already known how to eat and cook these types of food because they had eaten them in the past. It's possible that when farming started later on, it was easier for people to start eating these new crop foods because they were already familiar with them. This shows us that even though people lived very differently thousands of years ago, they still liked similar kinds of foods! It'd be interesting to know more about why these ancient people chose to eat these specific foods. Maybe scientists can find out by studying other things that people left behind, like bones or trash piles. That way, we could learn even more about what life was like back then and why certain foods became popular. It would also be cool to try cooking with ingredients that were available back then to see if they taste good! That way we could experience what it must have been like all those years ago. Who knows? Maybe we'll discover some tasty new recipes!"
"Cancer is a disease that is caused by the uncontrolled growth of cells . Normal cells can become cancerous if they acquire genetic mutations that allow them to divide more rapidly and ignore certain growth-halting signals from other cells in the body . Therefore , researchers are studying and cataloguing all the genetic changes found in cancers with the hope that this information will provide a clearer understanding of how they start to develop . Some types of mutations are well studied and easily identified by current technologies . However , some tumors contain few of these well-known mutations , which suggests that other types of mutations may be involved . Ni and Kuperwasser set out to discover some of these other types of genetic mutations in cancer cells and to find out how they contribute to cells becoming cancerous . Initial experiments showed that human breast cancer cells contain variants of proteins not found in healthy cells . In particular , there was a protein called MAGI3 that was abnormally short , but not due to any well-known mutations . This , in turn , led to the discovery of a type of mutation – called premature polyadenylation – affecting the gene that encodes MAGI3 . Next , Ni and Kuperwasser used biochemical techniques to show that the shortened MAGI3 protein inappropriately switches on another protein called YAP , which causes cells to grow more quickly . Approximately 7 . 5% of breast cancer patients have the shortened version of MAGI3 due to premature polyadenylation , which indicates that this might be a more widespread mutation than previously thought . Future studies will have to determine exactly how premature polyadenylation occurs in cancer cells , and whether it affects other genes and is found in other types of cancer ."," Scientists have found a way that some genes can be changed in people who get certain types of cancer. This happens when these genes make proteins that are too short because they were cut off early. These shorter versions of the proteins made by these genes actually help cancer grow faster. They call this shorter version of the gene ""MAGI3ppa"". They also found that this type of change only happened in some people's bodies, not everyone's. They think it might happen more often in women than men. They also looked at samples from real patients with different kinds of breast cancer and saw that some had high levels of MGIA3ppA. So far, scientists know about this problem mostly in breast cancer, but they think it could cause other types of cancers as well. It is important to keep looking into this problem so doctors will know if someone has this kind of cancer and what they should do about it. If you or your family members have been diagnosed with any kind of breast or ovarian cancer, talk to your doctor about whether you would like to learn more about this issue. Your doctor may want to order special tests to see if you have this kind or another genetic test to look for problems with other genes linked to hereditary breast or other gynecologic cancers."
"Our ability to recognize objects , and to respond instinctively to them , is something that is not fully understood . For example , seeing your favorite dessert could trigger an irresistible urge to eat it . Yet precisely how the image of the dessert could trigger an inner desire to indulge is a question that has so far eluded scientists . This compelling question also applies to the animal kingdom . Predators often demonstrate a typical hunting behavior upon seeing their prey from a distance . But just how the image of the prey triggers this hunting behavior is not known . Semmelhack et al . have now investigated this question by looking at the hunting behavior of zebrafish larvae . The larvae's prey is a tiny microbe that resembles a small moving dot . When the larvae encounter something that looks like their prey , they demonstrate a hardwired hunting response towards it . The hunting behavior consists of a series of swimming maneuvers to help the larvae successfully capture their prey . Semmelhack et al . used prey decoys to lure the zebrafish larvae , and video recordings to monitor the larvae's response . During the recordings , the larvae were embedded in a bed of jelly with only their tails free to move . The larvae's tail movements were recorded , and because the larvae are completely transparent , their brain activity could be visually monitored at the same time using calcium dyes . Using this approach , Semmelhack et al . identified a specific area of the brain that is responsible for triggering the larvae's hunting behavior . It turns out that this brain region forms a circuit that directly connects the retina at the back of the eye to nerve centers that control hunting maneuvers . So when the larva sees its prey , this circuit could directly trigger the larva's hunting behavior . When the circuit was specifically destroyed with a laser , this instinctive hunting response was impaired . These findings suggest that predators have a distinct brain circuit that hardwires their hunting response to images of their prey . Future studies would involve understanding precisely how this circuit coordinates the larvae's complex hunting behavior ."," Zebrafishes have been observed to exhibit specific behaviors when presented with certain kinds of food or predators. However, it is not yet known how these fish detect their potential meals. To investigate this question, researchers studied the hunting behavior of zebra fish larves using a special computer program that could classify different movements. They then used a technique called “two photon microscopy” to watch what happened inside the brain while the fish were watching various images on a screen. By looking at the activity of individual nerve cells, they discovered an area of the brain that became active only when the fish saw a particular kind of image – one that resembled the movement of a paramecium, a type of single cell organism that lives in water and moves around by whipping its hair-like cilia. Further experiments showed that this part of the fish’s brain received signals from two other parts of the eye, suggesting that there might be a separate pathway just for seeing things like paramecia. Finally, they looked more closely at some of the nerve cells in this part and found out where they connected to other parts in the brain. All together, these results suggest that there may be a special way for the fish to see parameia so that they can quickly decide whether to eat them or not."
"Division of labor is essential for cooperation , because groups can achieve more when individuals specialize in different tasks . This happens across the natural world , from different cells in organisms performing specific roles , to the individuals in an ant colony carrying out diverse duties . In both of these systems , individuals work together to ensure the survival of the collective unit – the body or the colony – instead of competing against each other . One of the main ways division of labor is evident within these two systems is regarding reproduction . Both in the body and in an ant colony , only one or a few individual units can reproduce , while the rest provide support . In the case of ant colonies , only queens and males reproduce , while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food . This intense cooperation requires close communication between individual units – in the case of some species of ants , by sharing fluids mouth-to-mouth . These fluids contain food but also many molecules produced by the ants themselves , including proteins . Given that both individuals and the colony as a whole change as they age – with workers acquiring new roles , and new queens and males only reared once the colony is mature – it is likely that the proteins transmitted in the fluid also change . To better understand whether the lifecycles of individuals and the age of the colony affect the fluids shared by carpenter ants Camponotus floridanus , Hakala et al . examined the ant-produced proteins in these fluids . This revealed differences in the proteins shared by young and mature colonies , and young nurse ants and older forager ants . In young colonies , the fluids contained proteins involved in fast sugar processing; while in mature colonies , the fluids contained more proteins to store nutrients , which help insect larvae grow into larger individuals , like queens . Young worker ants , who spend their time nursing the brood , produced more anti-aging proteins . This may be because these ants are in close contact with the queen , who lives much longer than the rest of the ants in the colony . Taken together , these observations suggest that ants divide the labor of metabolism , as well as work and reproduction . Dividing the labor of metabolism among individuals is one more similarity between ants and the cells of a multicellular organism , like a fly or a human . Division of labor allows the sharing of burden , with some individuals lightening the load of others . Understanding how ants achieve this by sharing fluids could shed new light on this complex exchange at other scales or in other organisms . By matching proteins to life stages , researchers have a starting point to examine individual molecules in more detail ."," In this study, researchers investigated the composition of a substance called trophhallactic fluid which is shared among ants living together in one nest. They found that the type of protein present in the fluid changes depending on what stage the colony is currently in during its lifespan. For example, they observed that younger colonies produce more proteins related to digestion while older colonies make more proteas, which help store nutrients for later use. Additionally, they noticed that some ants who take care of larvae had higher levels of certain proteins than others. This suggests that sharing substances may be important for helping ants work together effectively. Overall, their findings suggest that dividing tasks can happen not only within each individual ant but also across the entire group of ants. Studying how groups of animals divide up responsibilities can give us insights into how similar processes might work in humans too. By understanding how these kinds of interactions affect animal health, we can better appreciate how cooperation helps our own species thrive. However, it should be noted that there were limitations to this study due to technical difficulties in collecting enough samples from live ants to perform experiments. Despite this limitation, the results still provided valuable insights into the ways that ants interact with each other and manage their environment."
"It has been clear since the early days of structural biology in the late 1950s that proteins and other biomolecules are continually changing shape , and that these changes have an important influence on both the structure and function of the molecules . X-ray diffraction can provide detailed information about the structure of a protein , but only limited information about how its structure fluctuates over time . Detailed information about the dynamic behaviour of proteins is essential for a proper understanding of a variety of processes , including catalysis , ligand binding and protein–protein interactions , and could also prove useful in drug design . Currently most of the X-ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank are ‘snap-shots’ with limited or no information about protein dynamics . However , X-ray diffraction patterns are affected by the dynamics of the protein , and also by distortions of the crystal lattice , so three-dimensional ( 3D ) models of proteins ought to take these phenomena into account . Molecular-dynamics ( MD ) computer simulations transform 3D structures into 4D ‘molecular movies’ by predicting the movement of individual atoms . Combining MD simulations with crystallographic data has the potential to produce more realistic ensemble models of proteins in which the atomic fluctuations are represented by multiple structures within the ensemble . Moreover , in addition to improved structural information , this process—which is called ensemble refinement—can provide dynamical information about the protein . Earlier attempts to do this ran into problems because the number of model parameters needed was greater than the number of observed data points . Burnley et al . now overcome this problem by modelling local molecular vibrations with MD simulations and , at the same time , using a course-grain model to describe global disorder of longer length scales . Ensemble refinement of high-resolution X-ray diffraction datasets for 20 different proteins from the Protein Data Bank produced a better fit to the data than single structures for all 20 proteins . Ensemble refinement also revealed that 3 of the 20 proteins had a ‘molten core’ , rather than the well-ordered residues core found in most proteins: this is likely to be important in various biological functions including ligand binding , filament formation and enzymatic function . Burnley et al . also showed that a HIV enzyme underwent an order–disorder transition that is likely to influence how this enzyme works , and that similar transitions might influence the interactions between the small-molecule drug Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) and the enzymes it targets . Ensemble refinement could be applied to the majority of crystallography data currently being collected , or collected in the past , so further insights into the properties and interactions of a variety of proteins and other biomolecules can be expected ."," Scientists have found that many proteins move or shake slightly as they perform their functions. These small movements can be very important for how proteins work. However, when scientists use current methods to study these proteins using x-rays, they only see static pictures of one position of each atom in the protein. This means that we don't know about all the different positions that atoms in the proteins might occupy. To solve this problem, scientists developed new ways to take multiple pictures of the same protein and combine them together to make a ""movie"" showing all the possible places that atoms could be. They then used computer programs to figure out which places the atoms actually spend most of their time. By doing this, scientists learned that many of the proteinsthey studied had parts that were mostly still, but other parts that moved around a lot. Some proteins even had parts with lots of movement that seemed really important for helping the protein do its job! So now, scientists know that sometimes it's important for certain parts of proteins to stay put, and sometimes it helps if certain parts move around a bit. Understanding this will help us learn more about how proteinsnatural building blocks inside our bodiesthatare made up of tiny molecules called amino acidswork and why they sometimes need to move to do their jobs right."
"A common birth defect known as holoprosencephaly affects how the brain and face of a fetus develop in the womb . In many cases , the condition is so severe that the fetus dies before , or shortly after , birth . Mutations in certain genes that control how the fetus develops are associated with holoprosencephaly . For example , mutations in components of the Hedgehog and Nodal signaling pathways , which transmit information that help cells to become specialized , increase the risk that a fetus will develop holoprosencephaly . Environmental factors , such as exposure to alcohol in the womb , are also thought to contribute to this condition . A gene known as Cdon is a component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway . In 2012 , a team of researchers reported that mice with a mutation in the Cdon gene exposed to alcohol in the womb develop symptoms similar to holoprosencephaly in humans . Here , Hong et al . – including some of the researchers involved in the previous work – set out to understand how Cdon and alcohol work together to cause holoprosencephaly in the mutant mice . First , the team exposed pregnant mice to alcohol at different times during gestation to find out when their young were sensitive to developing holoprosencephaly . This showed that the young mice were most sensitive in early pregnancy when the Nodal pathway was active in their growing bodies . Further experiments found that alcohol and mutations in Cdon change Nodal signaling in cells . Together , these findings demonstrate that exposure to alcohol in the womb works together with the mutant form of Cdon via the Nodal signaling pathway , rather than the Hedgehog pathway , to cause holoprosencephaly in mice . The causes of many common birth defects are complex and difficult to distinguish at the level of individual cases . The work of Hong et al . illuminates how multiple risk factors during pregnancy , which may not create any problems on their own , may work together to produce birth defects in the fetus . The findings also offer new ways to understand how exposure to alcohol in the womb affects the fetus . Ultimately , understanding how birth defects form could lead to new strategies to prevent them in the future ."," Holoprosencaphy is a condition that affects how the brain develops early in pregnancy. This can lead to problems such as cleft lip or other facial abnormalities at birth. Sometimes this happens when pregnant women drink alcohol while they are carrying their baby. A certain type of protein called Condon helps control how cells communicate with each other. When there is a problem with this protein, babies may be more likely to have holopresencaphly. Researchers found out that drinking alcohol during pregnancy makes it harder for these proteins to work properly. They think this might happen because drinking alcohol changes how well the protein works. By understanding how different things like genes and drinking alcohol affect how the body grows and develops, doctors will be able to better help babies who are born with conditions like holoprenscaphly and prevent them from happening again. This could also help us understand why some people get sicknesses later in life. More research needs to be done before we know exactly what causes holopnescaphly so that we can find ways to stop it from happening. However, we already know that if you're pregnant, one way to protect your unborn baby is not to drink alcohol. If you need help quitting, talk to your doctor about options."
"Fine-tuning the amount of water present in the body at any given time is a tight balancing act . The hormone vasopressin helps to ensure that organisms do not get too dehydrated by allowing water in the urine to be reabsorbed into the bloodstream . A group of vasopressin neurons in the brain trigger the release of the hormone if water levels get too low ( as reflected by an increase in osmolality , the level of substances dissolved in a unit of blood ) . However , these cells also receive additional information that allows them to predict and respond to upcoming changes in water levels . For example , drinking water while dehydrated ‘switches off’ the neurons , even before osmolality is restored in the blood to normal levels . Eating , on the other hand , rapidly activates vasopressin neurons before the food is digested and blood osmolality increases as a result . How vasopressin neurons receive this ‘anticipatory’ information remains unclear . Kim et al . explored this question in mice by inhibiting different sets of brain cells one by one , and then examining whether the neurons could still exhibit anticipatory responses . This revealed a remarkable division of labor in the neural circuits that regulate vasopressin neurons: two completely different sets of neurons from distinct areas of the brain are dedicated to relaying anticipatory information about either water or food intake . These findings help to understand how healthy levels of water can be maintained in the body . Overall , they give a glimpse into the neural mechanisms that underlie anticipatory forms of regulation , which can also take place when hunger or thirst neurons ‘foresee’ that food or water will be consumed ."," This study looked at how our bodies control our fluid levels using a special kind of brain cell called a vasopression cell. Our brains have ways to help us keep our fluid level stable, both when things are normal and when there's a problem. One way to deal with problems is to react after something happens. Another way is to be ready beforehand for things that might happen. This second way is called ""feedforward"" or ""presystemic"" regulation. When it rains, you can just stay inside, or you can put on your raincoat before going out. Both work, but putting on the coat before going outside means you were ready for the rain even though you didn't know exactly when it would start. That's what presystem does - it gets your body ready for things like being too hot or cold or hungry or thirsty. It uses signals from other parts of your body to tell your brain what to do next. In this study, researchers found two different kinds of presystem regulation for making sure our fluids stay right where they should be. They found one circuit that helps us drink more if we need to because we're losing water, and another circuit that makes us stop drinking so much if we already had too much."
"The fossil traces of Stone Age humans and other animals in the Grotta della Bàsura cave system in Italy have been studied since the 1950s . Italian archaeologist Virginia Chiappella published the first studies; she documented bones from an extinct cave bear , human and animal footprints , charcoal from torches , finger marks , and lumps of clay stuck on the walls . Since then , many more archeologists and anthropologists have studied the cave and its fossils . Yet there are still lessons to be learned from this prehistoric site . Now , Romano et al . have combined a number of different approaches and used some of the latest technology and cutting-edge software to analyze 180 footprints and other tracks found in the cave . These trace fossils date to about 14 , 000 years ago , and the analysis revealed that they were left by a group of Stone Age humans who descended at least 400 meters into the cave . The group consisted of two adults , an adolescent and two children of about three and six years old . At one point they had to crawl through a low tunnel – something that has not previously been documented in the fossil record . The group were all barefoot , had no clothing on their arms and legs and used wooden torches to light the way . Together , these findings suggest that young children were active group members during the late Stone Age , even when carrying out apparently dangerous activities . Romano et al . now hope that their multidisciplinary approach may help other scientists looking to understand how humans behaved elsewhere in the world at various points in history ."," A team of scientists studied footprints found inside a cave in Italy called Bàsùra Cave. They used different methods like lasers, pictures, soil samples, plant remains, computer software, and special cameras to learn more about these footprints. These footprints were made by humans around 15,000 years ago! By using all this information together, they learned some important things about how early humans lived their lives. For example, they discovered that at least five people visited the cave and walked through it while barefoot. Some of them were adults, but one person was probably only three years old! This shows us that even little kids could be part of the hunter-gatherer groups that roamed the earth thousands of years ago. Another interesting thing the researchers found out was that some of the footprints showed marks left by clothes that were touching each other as people walked through the mud. This means that sometimes people wore pants or skirts when they went into the caves, which would have been helpful because it can get pretty cold down there. Overall, this study helps us understand what life was like for early humans who lived during the Ice Age many thousands of Years ago. It also reminds us that everyone, even babies, should be included in our studies so we can learn more and better understand how people live today too."
"Brains learn from experience . They take events from the past , link them together , and use them to predict the future . This is true for fruit flies , Drosophila melanogaster , as well as for humans . One of the main questions in the field of neuroscience is , how does this kind of associative learning happen ? Fruit fly larvae can learn to associate a certain smell with a sugar reward . When a group of larvae learn to associate a smell with sugar , most but not all of them will approach that smell in the future . This shows associative learning in action , but it raises a big question . Did the larvae that failed to approach the smell fail to learn , or did they just happen to make a mistake finding the smell ? Given another chance , would exactly the same larvae approach the smell as the first time ? In other words , did all the larvae learn a little , or did some larvae learn completely and others learn nothing ? To find out , Lesar et al . built a computer-controlled maze to test whether individual fruit fly larvae liked or avoided a smell . Whenever a larva reached the middle of the Y-shaped maze , it could choose to go down one of two remaining corridors . One corridor contained air and the other carbon dioxide , a gas they would naturally avoid . Lesar et al . taught each larva to like carbon dioxide by activating reward neurons in its brain while filling the maze with carbon dioxide gas . Studying each larva as it navigated the maze revealed that they learn in a single jump , a 'lightbulb moment' . When Lesar et al . activated the reward neurons , the larva either ‘got it’ and stopped avoiding carbon dioxide altogether , or it did not . In the second case , it behaved as if it had received no training at all . Classic and modern experiments on people suggest that humans might also learn in jumps , but research on our own brains is challenging . Fruit flies are an excellent model organism to study memory formation because they are easy to breed , and it is easy to manipulate their genetic code . Work in flies has already revealed many of the genes and cells responsible for learning and memory . But , to find the specific brain changes that explain learning , researchers need to know whether the animals they are examining have actually learned something . This new maze could help researchers to identify those individuals , making it easier to find out exactly how associative learning works ."," In this study, researchers used fruit flies as an animal model to investigate how the brain stores information about things that happen only once. They developed a new way to test whether fruit flies remember something they experienced just one time. To do so, they first taught the fruit flies to associate a certain smell with getting a tasty treat. Then, they tested if the fruit fly remembered what happened after being exposed to that same smell again. By using this method, the researchers found that some fruit flies learned to like the smell associated with good things happening, while other fruit flies did not learn to like that smell anymore. This shows that some of the fruit were able to store information about their experiences even though they had only experienced them once before. Additionally, the authors also showed that these stored memories could last for days or weeks. Overall, this work provides important insights into how our brains store information from our experiences. It will help us understand more about how we can make better decisions based on what we have already experienced. Understanding how our brain does this may lead to ways to improve human health and wellbeing. For instance, knowing more about this process might allow doctors to develop treatments for people who struggle to remember things. It might also help scientists build robots that can learn to solve problems faster than humans."
"Bats produce loud calls and listen to the returning echoes to find their way around . This process , known as echolocation , is sometimes described as 'seeing with sound' . The way bats perceive the world through echolocation , however , is fundamentally different from how we experience it through vision . Echolocation provides much less information about the world than vision does , but despite this , bats are agile navigators and hunters . It is not clear how bats navigate so well without much information . In particular , researchers would like to know how echolocating bats recognize the places that they regularly visit while foraging and navigating . When we visually recognize places , we identify and localize the various objects making up the scene . But echolocation is unlikely to provide enough information to allow bats to identify and localize the objects in a particular place . To investigate how bats recognize places , Vanderelst et al . built an artificial bat: a device that contained ultrasonic microphones to act like the bat’s ears and an ultrasonic speaker to act like the bat’s mouth . The artificial bat device was then used to collect echoes from different locations in real bat habitats . Processing the echoes using machine-learning techniques showed that the echoes that returned from each location were different enough for a computer to recognize the location . By using a simplified version of the echoes , Vanderelst et al . also showed that the locations could be recognized even if there was not enough information to identify specific objects or vegetation at the site . This suggests that bats do not simply use echolocation to recreate the three-dimensional layout of a location , as some researchers have proposed . While much remains to be learned about how bats use echolocation for navigation , future work that teases out bat navigation strategies might help us to build robots that can navigate using similar tactics ."," Bats use sound waves called ""echolocation"" to find food at night. They also remember where they've been so they don't fly into walls or get lost. Scientists think that bats store memories of the sounds they make near things like trees or rocks. These stored sounds help them know where they are when they fly back to those same spots later. To see if this was true, scientists recorded all the sounds made around some rocks, trees, and water. Then they used special math to look at the sounds again. The math showed that each spot had its own unique set of sounds. This means that bots could tell which rock or tree they were flying next to because their sounds were different from other sounds. Just like people use pictures to remember where things are, bats may use special sounds as pictures to help them navigate. This helps them build a kind of mental map of the world around them! So, just like humans need pictures to know where things in the world are, even bats do too – but instead of pictures, they use special kinds of sounds! That way, they can always find good places to eat insects and sleep during the day. Yum yum! Science is fun! And now you know more about bats and how they live."
"A protective membrane surrounds all cells , and controls what goes in and out of the cell . Many proteins that are made inside the cell need to be exported in order to do their job . In most organisms , a specialised transport motor that sits inside the membrane , known as 'Sec' , carries out this export process . Sec recognises proteins that need to be exported and pushes them across the membrane and out of the cell . The energy required to do this comes from the cell's universal power source , a molecule called ATP . Previous studies have shown what Sec looks like , but not how it pushes proteins from one side of the membrane to the other . Currently , the most popular theory for how Sec works is that it grabs hold of part of the protein and pushes it through a gate in the membrane . It then lets go and goes back to grab and push the next bit of the protein . Allen , Corey , Oatley et al . have now used a combination of experimental and computational methods to look at how the different parts of Sec move around as it uses ATP . The reasoning behind using these methods was that it's easier to understand how a motor works by watching it in action rather than just looking at a still picture . Using these methods , Allen , Corey , Oatley et al . show that the biggest movement in Sec as it uses ATP is in the membrane gate itself , which opens and closes . This suggests that Sec acts like a turnstile: proteins can freely move one way across the membrane , but are prevented from moving back in again . This mechanism has not been described before and may apply to other transport systems . Further investigations will be needed to understand exactly how Sec recognises cargo and starts the transport process , and to explore the specific features of a protein that activate the turnstile . It also remains to be discovered how this transport process differs in other , non-bacterial cells . This could potentially help us develop new drugs that specifically block the bacterial Sec system without affecting human cells ."," Proteins need to be moved across cell membranes so they can perform their functions inside or outside cells. To do this, proteins use a special machine called ""Sec"" that helps them cross the membrane. One part of the machine, called SecA, uses energy from Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) to help move proteins into place. Another part of it, called the Sec complex, actually moves the proteins across the membranes. How exactly these parts work together was not well understood. Now scientists have used computer modeling and experiments to figure out how they work together better. They found that when SecA makes one type of chemical change, it pushes on the Sec machine, making it open up wider. At the same time, the proteons being moved push back on SecA. These forces cause the proteon to go deeper into the channel made by the SecA and Sec machines. Then another chemical change happens, causing SecA to let go of the ATP. Once this happens, the Sec machines close again, trapping the protease on the other side of the membran. So, the movements of the proteases are like a game of tug-of-war between SecA pulling on one end and the proteas pushing back on the opposite end. By doing this many times over, the protein gets pulled completely across the cell membrane"
"In most adult animals , male and female brains are slightly different . For example , in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , certain neurons exist in one sex but not the other . Nerve cells that are shared in both sexes may also activate different genes , or form different connections in males and females . Most of these differences – which ultimately give rise to sex-specific behaviors – emerge during a period of development called sexual maturation . Yet , the mechanisms that control when sexual differentiation takes place in the brain are largely unknown . To investigate this , Pereira et al . set out to determine how sex differences arise in the nervous system of C . elegans , a small animal with two sexes , male and hermaphrodite . In particular , Pereira et al . wanted to know which genes cause certain neurons that are present in both sexes to switch to the male-specific form when the worm gets old enough . The experiments revealed that a genetic pathway formed of three genes , let-7 , lin-28 and lin-41 , controls when sexual maturation takes place throughout the worm nervous system . When the worm is young , lin-41 is active and represses a gene called lin-29A . As the animal reaches maturity , let-7 ‘switches off’ lin-41 , and lin-29A gets activated in a subset of neurons . These brain cells then turn on male-specific genes and acquire a shape only found in males . The anatomy of male mutant worms that lack lin-29A is normal , but the animals show features found in hermaphrodites , for example in the way they crawl across a dish . This shows that activating lin-29A may also trigger male-specific behaviors . Switching on sex-specific neuronal circuits at the correct time is essential for animals to develop correctly . The lin-7 and let-28 genes also control when sexual maturation takes place in mammals , so studying these genes in C . elegans could help to understand how male and female brains are shaped during development in other species , and why some diseases affect the sexes differently ."," In this study, researchers investigated how certain genes called ""miRNAs"" help determine when cells become female or male during the development of the worm C. elegans' nervous system. They discovered that one particular type of miRNAS, called ""let- 7,"" helps decide whether certain nerve cells will be female or males. This happens because these nerve cells have something called ""sex- shared genes."" These genes are important for both females and males but they turn on (are active) differently depending on what sex the worm is. Let-7 works together with another gene called ""lin- 41"" which turns on some other genes called “sex determining genes.” One of those genes is called ""LIN-20."" When LIN -20 is turned on, it causes the nerve cell to develop into a male instead of a female. Researchers also learned that there are two other genes that work like LIN – 20. All three of these genes are turned on if let- 6 is present and if the worm has XX chromosomes. If all three of them are turned off, then the nerve cells develop as females. Overall, this study shows that let-6 plays an important role in helping to determine when nerve cells become male or female."
"Sex allows two individuals of a species to combine their genetic information and generate new offspring . As such , and unlike most of the cells that make up an organism , reproductive cells carry DNA that will be passed to the next generation . To prepare for sexual reproduction , reproductive cells undergo a process whereby they give up half of their DNA . Moreover , in many species , reproductive cells undergo dramatic changes in size and shape to become specialized as eggs or sperm . For two decades , research scientists have made use of an antibody that specifically targets and labels reproductive cells in mice and rats , long before they become recognizable as sperm or eggs . However , nothing was known about the protein that this antibody recognizes . Now , Carmell et al . have found that the antibody recognizes a protein called GCNA . This protein was previously thought to be limited to mice and rats . However , GCNA is in fact a member of a far-flung family of proteins that had gone unnoticed by researchers due to their unusual composition and large unstructured regions . Carmell et al . show that this protein family extends beyond rodents and even mammals , and actually exists in all branches of eukaryotic life , including plants and single-celled organisms . In most species examined , the genes encoding these proteins are most active in reproductive cells . The most important next step is to figure out precisely what GCNA proteins are doing in reproductive cells . This will also hopefully explain why these proteins appear to have been conserved for more than 2 billion years , throughout the entire history of eukaryotes ."," Scientists have discovered a type of protein called GCNA that helps make new copies of genes inside our bodies. This protein was found in many different types of living things like plants, fungi, worms, insects, fish, frogs, birds, mammals, and even some bacteria. It seems this protein has been around since very early on in life's history here on Earth. Researchers think it might help keep our body's genetic code safe when we pass down copies of ourselves to offspring. They also think it could be used to fix mistakes made in copying DNA. Further studies will need to be done to fully understand how this protein works and what exactly its role is in making more copies of us. But so far, scientists know that without this protein, many kinds of living beings wouldn't exist today! That means this special kind of protein is really important for all life on Earth! And now we know where it came from and why it's so useful. Who knew one little protein could do so much? Pretty amazing! Science is pretty cool sometimes. 😊🔬🧫 #ScienceIsCool #GCNAPaperSummary #LaySummariesForScientificPapers"
"In female mammals , eggs made in the ovaries travel to the uterus via tubes called oviducts ( or Fallopian tubes ) . If sperm fertilize these eggs on the way , they complete this journey as early embryos and then implant into the wall of the uterus . As sperm and then newly fertilized embryos travel down these tubes , they encounter fluid inside the oviduct , which is generated by the cells that line the tube . The hormonal changes that occur with the menstrual cycle alter the complexity and cellular composition of the uterus . When an egg is fertilized , further changes in the levels of the hormones , estrogen and progesterone , ensure the uterus becomes receptive to the embryo . However , it remains unknown whether such hormone-mediated signals also regulate the oviduct to support fertilization and early embryo development . To investigate this question , Winuthayanon et al . studied female mice that lack an important estrogen receptor in the cells that line their oviducts and uterus . These mice are infertile . This is partly because most sperm become stuck in the uterus and fail to reach the eggs in the oviduct in order to fertilize them . The oviduct also becomes a hostile environment for both eggs and embryos , as reflected in damaged eggs and the complete loss of all new embryos by two days after fertilization . These embryos die , not because their development fails , but because their outer membrane becomes damaged and breaks apart . Winuthayanon et al . showed that this is due to the persistence of enzymes that form part of the immune system inside the oviduct . These enzymes can degrade proteins and damage cell membranes . The presence of this estrogen receptor on the inner lining of the oviduct thus appears to be crucially important for reproduction ( these effects were not seen when it is removed from other cells of the oviduct ) . The loss of this receptor also reveals the vital role that estrogen plays in suppressing parts of the immune response to ensure the oviduct provides a supportive environment for fertilization and embryo development . These findings could also have future application in the development of new contraceptives and might also shed light on the causes of human infertility ."," This study looked at how female hormones affect the ability of an egg to be fertilised and survive until it reaches two cell stages. They found that when they removed a type of hormone receptor from the ovaries and uteri of mice, there was less chance of successful fertilisation because fewer sperm were able to reach the eggs. Of those eggs that did get fertilise, many died before reaching the next stage of development. Further experiments showed this was caused by high levels of certain chemicals called proteins which can break down the outer layer of the egg. When they added special chemicals to stop these proteins working, the eggs survived better even though their environment lacked the usual hormonal signal. This suggests that the hormone signal helps keep the level of proteins low so that the eggs can grow properly. This could help us understand why some women struggle to become pregnant and why some methods of emergency contraceptions work after sex has already taken place. More studies like this one will help us find ways to make these methods more effective. However, further research needs to be done first. Overall, this study shows that female hormone signals play important roles in helping eggs survive and develop properly. It also highlights the importance of understanding how different chemical signals interact within our bodies to control important processes such as reproduction."
"In female mammals , granulosa cells in the ovaries help egg cells to grow and develop by secreting nutrients and estrogens—the female sex hormones . A protein called FOXL2 helps granulosa cells to develop and functions by binding to the DNA of the cells to switch certain genes either on or off . In humans , mutations in the gene that codes for the FOXL2 protein are associated with granulosa cell tumors and with a loss of female fertility in early adulthood . In addition , if the amount of FOXL2 is artificially reduced in granulosa cells in female mice , the cells take on many of the characteristics of supporting cells found in the testes of males . To investigate in more detail how FOXL2 works , Georges et al . grew mouse granulosa cells in the laboratory to identify the DNA sequences where FOXL2 will bind , and to uncover how this binding affects gene expression . Georges et al . conclude that FOXL2 orchestrates a network involving many different proteins that allows estrogen to be produced and used by granulosa cells; and in doing so these cells maintain their identity as ovarian cells . FOXL2 was also shown to work closely with the receptor proteins that detect the sex hormones , and which help to control whether particular sex-specific genes are switched on or off . One particularly important role of FOXL2 in granulosa cells is that it represses a gene called Sox9 . By repressing Sox9 , the granulosa cells do not transform into their counterparts normally found in testes . Although FOXL2 was previously reported to directly regulate the Sox9 gene , Georges et al . find that it also acts through other molecules , and that there are alternative ways in which it can do so . Although Georges et al . have established some of the ways that FOXL2 functions , this protein can work via other pathways; these will require further investigation to be fully understood ."," Scientists have discovered that a certain protein called FOXl2 helps keep the right type of cells alive in our bodies. These cells are important because they help make eggs inside our body. They also help protect them from turning into male parts instead of female ones. To do this, FOX12 works together with another kind of protein called an ""estrogen"" receptor. Estrogens are hormones that can affect how our bodies grow and develop. Without enough estrogen or if there's something wrong with it, things like cancer could happen. So having too much or too little estrogen can be bad for us. But when everything is working well, estrogen helps keep women healthy. It makes their bones strong, keeps their skin looking good, and even helps them feel better emotionally. However, sometimes problems can happen where either FOXI2 doesn't work properly anymore or the estrogen isn't doing what it should. That's why scientists did this study – to learn more about how these two proteins work together so we might find ways to fix any problems that come up. By understanding more about them, maybe doctors will know exactly which treatment to give people who have those kinds of issues. And then they can get better faster!"
"Pheromones are chemicals that are given off by living things and they lead to a range of social responses in others of the same species . These chemical signals , for example , can let an animal know when a suitable mate is near and trigger the release of hormones that encourage the animal to mate . In mammals , an organ found between the roof of the mouth and the nose detects pheromones . This organ contains more than 300 different receptors for these chemicals . However , only a few of these receptors have been matched with the pheromones that they detect . One example is a chemical released by male mice that interacts with a specific nasal receptor and causes a female mouse to arch her back in a way that signals she is ready to mate . One reason that more pheromone-receptor pairs are not known is that pheromones are released in very small quantities , which makes them hard to detect . In an effort to identify more pairs , Haga-Yamanaka et al . took tissue slices from the organ that detects pheromones in mice and then looked for cells that responded to the urine of female mice . Two previously unknown pheromone-receptor pairs were found . One helps male mice detect when a female is present , while the other lets him know if she is ready to mate . Together these two chemicals alert a male mouse to a potential mate and cause him to mount her in order to mate . However , neither chemical is able to trigger this male courtship behavior on its own . The techniques developed by Haga-Yamanaka et al . may , in the future , help identify more pheromone-receptor pairs . The next challenge will be to identify the pathways of nerve cells that integrate the information about pheromones and trigger the courtship behaviors ."," Scientists have found that males use their sense of smell to figure out if females around them are interested in having sex. They do this by smelling chemicals called pheremones, which are secreted through urine or sweat. Males can tell whether females are ready to mate based on these chemicals. However, it's not known exactly what kind of chemical messages males receive from females. To solve this problem, scientists used special ""nose drops"" called ""vomeronasals,"" which allow them to pick up very small amounts of pheromones. By using these nose drops, they were able to find several new types of pheroemones that males could smell. Some of these chemicals told males whether females were ready to have sex, while others told males who had been chosen by females. Interestingly, some of these pheromes were detected by more than one type of vomeronasa! This suggests that males need to smell many different kinds of phemones at once to know that females want to have sxe. When males smelled just one type or another of these female phemes, they didn't feel like having sex with females. But when males smelled all of the female phemons at once, then they felt like having sxe right away! So, males might use different kinds pherome sensors to decide when it' s time to have sex with females!"
"Genes are sections of DNA that carry the instructions needed to build other molecules including all the proteins that the cell needs to fulfill its role . The information in the DNA is stored as a code consisting of four chemical bases , often referred to simply as “A” , “C” , “G” and “T” . The order or sequence of these bases determines the role of a protein . Many organisms – including humans – are built of many different types of cells that perform unique roles . Almost all cells carry the same genetic information , but proteins called transcription factors can regulate the activity of genes so that only a relevant subset of genes is switched on at a particular time . Transcription factors glide along DNA and bind to short DNA sequences by attaching to the DNA bases directly or through bridges made up of water molecules . Two physical concepts known as enthalpy and entropy determine the strength of the connection . Enthalpy relates to how strong the chemical bonds that form between the transcription factors and the DNA bases are , compared to a situation where the transcription factor and DNA do not form a complex and bind to water molecules around them . Entropy measures the disorder of the system – the more disordered the solvent and protein-DNA complex are compared to solvent-containing free DNA and protein , the stronger the binding . A water molecule that bridges a DNA base with an amino-acid of a protein contributes to enthalpy , but results in loss of entropy , because the system becomes more ordered since the water molecule can no longer move freely . Most transcription factors can only bind to DNA sequences that are very similar to each other , but some transcription factors can recognize several different kinds of sequences , and until now it was not clear how they could do this . Morgunova et al . studied four different human transcription factors that can each bind to two distinct DNA sequences . The results showed that the transcription factors bound to both DNA sequences with similar strength , but via different mechanisms . For one DNA sequence , an enthalpy-based mechanism essentially ‘froze’ the transcription factor to the DNA through rigid water bridges . The other DNA sequence was bound equally strongly but through moving water molecules , because this increased the entropy of the system . It is possible that these mechanisms could also apply to many other molecules that interact with each other through water-molecule bridges . A better knowledge of the chemical bonds between transcription factors and DNA bases may in future help efforts to develop new treatments that depend on molecules being able to bind to other molecules . In addition , these findings may one day help scientists to predict how strongly two molecules will interact simply by knowing the structures of the molecules involved ."," Transcription factors are proteins that control gene expression by attaching themselves to specific regions of DNA called binding sites. Some transcription factor genes have multiple preferred binding sites that look very similar but differ slightly from each other. Scientists wanted to understand how these different binding sites could be so close together without being identical. They used high-tech equipment to figure out exactly which parts of the protein attached to which part of the DNA. Then they measured how much energy it took to attach the protein to one type of binding site versus another. They found that even though the attachment looked like it should take more or less energy depending on what kind of binding sites were involved, the amount of energy required was actually about the same. Further investigation showed that the difference came from how tightly packed the molecules were when they were attached to the different types of binding sides. These findings help scientists better understand how certain transcription genes work and may lead to new ways to treat diseases caused by problems with those genes. In short, the study shows that sometimes there are several places where a particular protein can bind next to a piece of DNA, and although all of them seem pretty good, they still might not be completely equal. By looking closer at how the protein interacts with the DNA, researchers figured out why this happens."
"Many bacteria , including several that cause diseases in people , have long whip-like appendages called flagella that extend well beyond their cell walls . Flagella can rotate and propel the bacteria through liquids , such as water or blood , and they are constructed primarily from thousands of copies of a single protein called flagellin . When flagella are built , the flagellin proteins are placed in their proper positions by another protein called FliD , several copies of which form a cap on the end of flagella . Without FliD , bacteria cannot properly assemble flagella and , thus , can no longer swim; this also hinders their ability to cause disease . Determining the three-dimensional structure of a protein , down to the level of its individual atoms , can provide unique insights into how the protein operates . However , no one had resolved the structure of a FliD protein from any bacterium to this level of detail before . Now , Postel et al . report the high-resolution structure of a large fragment of FliD from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The structure reveals that parts of this FliD protein are shaped like parts of other proteins from which flagella are constructed , including the flagellin protein that FliD places into position . Some parts of the FliD protein are also very flexible and these parts of the protein are responsible for holding numerous FliD proteins together as a cap . Finally , Postel et al . saw that six copies of FliD bind to one another to form a protein complex on the end of flagella . This last finding was particularly unexpected since it was thought that all FliD proteins formed five-membered cap complexes , an assumption that was based largely on studies of FliD from another bacterium called Salmonella . The current structure covers about half of the FliD protein , and so the next challenge is to determine the structure of the full-length protein . An improved understanding of the structure of FliD may , in future , help researchers to design drugs that stop bacteria from building flagella and , therefore , from swimming and causing disease ."," Scientists have discovered how different types of bacteria use proteins called flagellal capping to help them move around. These proteins work together like a team to make sure that the proteins needed to build these little tails come out correctly. Without these proteins, the bacteria can't move properly or cause disease. To understand more about how these protections work, scientists studied one type of flagelllal capped protein found in a kind of bacteria called pseudomonas. They used special tools to look very closely at this protein and figure out its shape. By looking carefully at the shapes of these proteons, scientists were able to learn some new things about how they work. First, they learned that these proteon shapes are related to other kinds of proteons involved in making the tail. Second, they found that these particular proteons form groups of six pieces instead of just one big group. Third, they figured out that these groups of proteos need certain parts of themselves to be able to stick together. Finally, they realized that different kinds of bacteria might use slightly different versions of these groups because the tails made by different kinds bacteria are also slightly different. This discovery helps us better understand how these tiny living creatures move around and cause diseases. It could also help doctors find ways to stop them!"
"Tiny Gram-negative bacteria are one of humankind's deadliest foes , causing infections of wounds and the bloodstream that are very hard to treat . Many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to several common antibiotics , and the few treatments available that can successfully kill the bacteria are often also toxic to the patients . Understanding how these bacteria elude antibiotics could help scientists develop better , less toxic treatments . Most bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall that helps protect the bacteria and gives them structure . Many broad-spectrum antibiotics , including penicillin and vancomycin , work by interfering with how this protective wall is built from molecules called peptidoglycans . However , Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that prevents many antibiotics from reaching the cell wall , and so the antibiotics are unable to kill the bacteria . The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is made up of sugars and fatty molecules called lipids . Recently , scientists discovered a mutation that interferes with the movement of the lipid and sugar molecules that make up the outer membrane , which compromises this protective layer and makes the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics . To learn more about how this mutation interferes with the defenses of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Grabowicz et al . searched for compensating mutations that can counteract it and restore the antibiotic resistance of these mutant bacteria . The search revealed that a mutation in a gene called waaL increases E . coli's resistance to vancomycin , but not to other antibiotics . The gene encodes an enzyme , and the mutant form of the enzyme attaches some peptidoglycans to the surface of the outer membrane instead of incorporating them into the cell wall . The stray peptidoglycans on the cell's surface act as decoys , binding to vancomycin and keeping the drug from reaching its true target—the cell wall . The decoy strategy is similar to a mechanism used by Gram-positive bacteria—which lack a protective outer membrane—to resist vancomycin treatment , which also involves creating sites that bind the drug and keep it from its target . Vancomycin is not currently used clinically to treat E . coli or other Gram-negative infections because these bacteria are naturally quite resistant for other reasons . However , Grabowicz et al . 's findings do demonstrate how quickly bacteria can adapt and produce new defenses to antibiotics when old strategies fail ."," Scientists found a way to make a type of bacteria called Escheria Coli produce a special kind of sugar molecule called Lipopolysacharride (LPS) that can attach itself to another important part of the bacterial body called Peptidogycans (PG). Normally, this LPS stays inside the bacteria's body and protects it from being attacked by things like viruses or other harmful chemicals. But when scientists made this change to the bacteria, they noticed that some kinds of antibiotics stopped working properly because the antibioties were getting stuck to the LPS instead of going into the bacteria where they could do their job. So now there is a new type of Escheriea Coli out there that has a different kind of LPS than normal and might be able to survive better if people use certain types of antibotics to try to kill them. It also means that doctors will need to pay attention to whether or not these changes happen before using any new antibiotcs that come out. That way, they know which ones might still work against these new superbugs. And maybe one day scientists will find a way around this problem so that all our antibiotcis stay strong no matter what. Who knows? Maybe one day they'll even figure out how to turn regular bugs into superbug"
"TRPM3 belongs to a family of channel proteins that allow sodium and calcium ions to enter cells by forming pores in cell membranes . TRPM3 is found on the cell membranes of nerve cells; when ions flow into the nerves through the TRPM3 pores it triggers an electrical impulse . TRPM3 is responsible for helping us to detect heat , and mice without this protein find it difficult to sense painfully hot temperatures . Mice lacking TRPM3 also respond to other kinds of pain differently . Normally , a mouse with an injured paw becomes more sensitive to warm and hot temperatures , but this does not happen in mice that do not have TRPM3 . When activated , other proteins called G-protein coupled receptors ( or GPCRs for short ) can make some members of this family of channel proteins more or less likely to open their pore . This in turn increases or decreases the flow of ions through the pore , respectively . Yet it was not clear if GPCRs also affect TRPM3 channels on the membranes of nerve cells . Quallo et al . have now discovered that “switching on” different GPCR proteins in sensory nerve cells from mice greatly reduces the flow of calcium ions though TRPM3 channels . The experiments made use of two pain-killing drugs , namely morphine and baclofen , and a molecule called neuropeptide Y to activate different GPCRs . GPCRs interact with a group of small proteins called G-proteins that , when activated by the receptor , split into two subunits , known as the α subunit and the βγ subunit . Once detached these subunits are free to act as messengers and interact with other proteins in the cell membrane . Quallo et al . found that TRPM3 is one of a small group of proteins that interact with the βγ subunits of the G-protein , which can explain how “switching on” GPCRs reduces the activity of TRPM3 . Two independent studies by Dembla , Behrendt et al . and Badheka , Yudin et al . also report similar findings . There is currently a need to find more effective treatments for people suffering from long-term pain conditions and it has become clear that TRPM3 channels are involved in sensing both pain and temperature . These new findings show that drugs already used in the treatment of pain can dramatically change how TRPM3 works . These results might help scientists to find drugs that work in a similar way to dial down the activity of TRPM3 and to combat pain . Though first it will be important to confirm these new findings in human nerve cells ."," This study found that certain chemicals called ""G beta gamma"" proteins can reduce pain signals from cells called ""transient receptorial potential melastatin 3"" or TRPM 3. These cells are located in nerves in mice's bodies. When these cells become active, they send messages through the nerve fibers to tell our brains that we feel something like heat, cold, itchiness, or even pain. The authors found that when the G beta gammma proteins were added to these cells, their ability to send out pain signals was reduced. They think this happens because the Gbeta gamma proteins directly interact with the TRPM cells. In addition, if you take drugs that activate other types of cells called G protein-coupling receptiors (GPCR), then the amount of pain signaling coming from the TRMP cells will change. For example, some drugs that go along with the GPCRS cells make the pain worse, while others help relieve the pain. Overall, this study shows how different parts of your body work together to control feelings of pain. It may lead to new ways to treat chronic pain in people. However, more studies need to be done before any treatments based on this research can be used."
"Immune cells called CD4 T cells help the body build immunity to infections caused by bacteria and viruses , or after vaccination . Receptor proteins on the outside of the cells recognize pathogens , foreign molecules called antigens , or vaccine antigens . Vaccine antigens are usually inactivated bacteria or viruses , or fragments of these pathogens . After recognizing an antigen , CD4 T cells develop into memory CD4 T cells ready to defend against future infections with the pathogen . People who have never been exposed to a pathogen , or have never been vaccinated against it , may nevertheless have preexisting memory cells ready to defend against it . This happens because CD4 T cells can recognize multiple targets , which enables the immune system to be ready to defend against both new and familiar pathogens . Elias , Meysman , Bartholomeus et al . wanted to find out whether having preexisting memory CD4 T cells confers an advantage for vaccine-induced immunity . Thirty-four people who were never exposed to hepatitis B or vaccinated against it participated in the study . These individuals provided blood samples before vaccination , with 2 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine , and at 3 time points afterward . Using next generation immune sequencing and machine learning techniques , Elias et al . analyzed the individuals’ memory CD4 T cells before and after vaccination . The experiments showed that preexisting memory CD4 T cells may determine vaccination outcomes , and people with more preexisting memory cells develop quicker and stronger immunity after vaccination against hepatitis B . This information may help scientists to better understand how people develop immunity to pathogens . It may guide them develop better vaccines or predict who will develop immunity after vaccination ."," This study looked at how well people respond to a new vaccine against hepatits B virus. They found that some people who had not been exposed to the virus before already had certain types of ""memory"" T cells that were ready to fight off the infection if they got it from the vaccine. These pre-existing memory T-cells helped these people make better antibodies after getting the vaccine than those without them. By looking at the type of T-Cells present in someone's body, researchers could tell whether or not they would likely get sick after being vaccinated. This means that doctors might be able to use this method to figure out which patients should get the vaccine first, so that they benefit most from it. It also shows us that sometimes our bodies are prepared to fight diseases even though we don’t know it! That’s pretty cool! And now scientists know what kinds of things to look for when trying to find out why some people don’ t react as strongly to vaccinations as others do. So, next time you get a shot, remember that your body might already have special superhero T- Cells hiding inside of it, just waiting to come out and save the day! Yay! Science is awesome! 👊"
"Protein filaments called microtubules help move cargo around inside cells . Chromosomes , which contain the cell’s genetic blueprints , are the microtubule’s most precious cargo . Before a cell divides , microtubules grow from the ends of the dividing cell towards the middle , where they attach to the chromosomes that are lined up along the centerline . Then the microtubules shrink and drag the chromosomes back to the opposite ends of the cell . This allows each of the new cells to get one copy of each chromosome . When the microtubules are growing , a molecule called guanosine triphosphate ( or GTP ) is attached to the proteins at the end of the filament . This acts like a cap and protects the microtubule from shrinking . Later a chemical reaction converts GTP into GDP ( short for guanosine diphosphate ) . Without the protective GTP cap , the microtubule quickly shrinks . At the same time , the proteins that make up the microtubule also change shape . In the microtubule , the proteins adopt a straight shape when GTP is attached . The proteins favor a different shape in the microtubule when GDP is attached . However , it is unclear if or how these shape changes contribute to how a microtubule grows or shrinks . Geyer et al . now show how this shape shifting can influence microtubule shrinking , by first identifying a mutation in yeast microtubule proteins that cause the proteins to remain straight even when GDP is attached . Next , powerful microscopes were used to make time-lapse videos of the mutated microtubules . This allowed Geyer et al . to observe how the mutated microtubules behaved and compare this to the behavior of normal microtubules . The experiments revealed that the mutated microtubules were less likely to begin shrinking than typical microtubules . The mutated microtubules also shrunk more slowly . These findings indicate that the shape changes control the speed of shrinking and frequency of entering the shrinking phase . These new details about the control of microtubule growth and shrinkage may help scientists studying how cell division happens in both healthy and cancerous cells ."," Scientists have found a way to slow down how fast some tiny structures called microtutbles break apart or fall apart (called ""catastrophies"" or ""shrinkage""). They did this by finding a special kind of ""mistake"" in the structure of the building blocks of those tiny structures. This mistake made them less likely to break apart when they changed from one shape to another. It also meant that once they were formed, it took longer before they would start breaking apart again. So, even though the mistake didn't make the building block look any different than normal, it still helped the tiny structures last longer. The scientists think this happens because the mistake makes the building bricks more likely to stay in one particular shape after they join together. That means there might be ways to find other mistakes like this one that could help tiny structures live longer too! And if so, maybe doctors can use those mistakes to help patients who need new versions of those little structures. Or maybe they could teach those little things to grow stronger or stick around longer inside people’s bodies. But first, scientists will have to figure out exactly why these mistakes work and whether they really do work in people’ s bodies. Then, they may be able to use them to help treat diseases caused by problems with those tiny things."
"To produce a protein , a stretch of DNA must first be transcribed to produce a molecule of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . The genetic information copied from the DNA is then read three letters at a time , in groups called codons . Each codon either encodes a particular amino acid to be added into a protein or provides further instructions: ‘start codons’ mark the beginning of a protein; ‘stop codons’ mark its end . The DNA between these two points is called an open reading frame ( or ORF ) —however , not all ORFs produce proteins . Most proteins are made of several hundred amino acids , but the genomes of animals contain thousands of ORFs that would generate much smaller proteins made of fewer than 100 amino acids , if they were translated . It is , however , unclear how many of these small ORFs are converted into mRNA molecules and functional proteins . Ribosomes are large molecular machines that translate the code in mRNA molecules and join together the appropriate amino acids in the right order to make a protein . Ribosome profiling is a technique that identifies which mRNA molecules are translated into proteins by determining the sequences of all the mRNA molecules bound to ribosomes at a particular moment . The mRNA sequences can then be compared with the sequence of the whole genome to work out which ORFs they correspond to . Ribosome profiling has been used to detect translated small ORFs , but the method yields a relatively high false positive rate as some mRNAs can bind to ribosomes without being translated . To better detect small protein-producing ORFs , Aspden et al . developed a technique based on ribosome profiling called Poly-Ribo-Seq . The method takes advantage of the fact that during active translation , clusters of multiple ribosomes , called polysomes , bind mRNAs . Poly-Ribo-Seq isolates these polysomes and determines the sequence bound by each of the ribosomes , thereby reducing the number of false positives . Applying Poly-Ribo-Seq to cells from the fruit fly Drosophila allowed Aspden et al . to identify two types of short ORF . The first type codes for proteins that are around 80 amino acids long and are translated with the same efficiency as larger ORFs . The sequences of these ORFs are found in other species , match at least in part sequences of known functional ORFs , and the proteins produced are found in specific locations inside cells . These small proteins may contribute to membrane integrity or function . Together , these properties suggest that these mRNAs create functional small proteins . The second pool consists of very small ORFs ( ‘dwarf smORFs’ ) that code for around 20 amino acids , which are not translated so often and do not show many similarities with other species . As the findings of Aspden et al . suggest that a large fraction of Drosophila small ORFs are translated into proteins , the next challenge will be to determine the roles of these small proteins in cells ."," Scientists use tiny pieces of DNA called ""smORF"" as possible protein coding regions. They want to know how many of these smORFS there are and if they can make real proteins. To do so, they used special technology to see which parts of the DNA were being read by ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules inside cells. This showed them which parts could be making proteins because those parts had been read. They then looked at all the different parts that were read and saw two kinds of smorf: one kind was longer and like other proteins, while the other was smaller and usually located before or between genes. These smaller ones might not really make proteins since they did not match up with things scientists look for when trying to find new proteins from smORfs. Overall, it seems lots of smorfs may be able to make proteINS! This means that scientists need to keep looking into smORfS to figure out what they do and why they are important. It also shows us that even though something looks like it should work, that does not mean it will! Sometimes science is hard and takes a lot of work to understand. But, if we keep asking questions and investigating, maybe we will learn more about how our bodies work and how to help people stay healthy!"
"Our sense of touch depends upon receptors in our skin that send signals to the brain about the objects with which we interact . Different types of touch receptors respond in different ways when we grasp and manipulate objects; for example , by altering the strength of their response or its timing . Saal et al . have now investigated how neurons in a part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex , which processes touch signals from the hand , respond to the information from the different receptor types . First , recordings were made of the electrical activity of the touch receptors and the neurons in the brain of monkeys . Using this data , Saal et al . built computer models that allow the response of neurons in the brain to be predicted from the responses of the touch receptors . The models showed that signals from different types of touch receptors shape the response of neurons in the brain in different ways . One receptor type controls how strong a neuron’s response will be , while another one controls the precise timing of the response . Further investigation revealed that this way of combining the signals from the different receptors preserves as much information as possible about objects and thereby helps the brain to process information acquired by touch quickly and efficiently . Future experiments will examine how touch is represented in two structures that lie between the receptors and the somatosensory cortex: one in the brainstem , the other in a brain region called the thalamus ."," This study investigates how our brain processes tactile stimuli, which refers to the sensation of touch through skin receptors. Previous studies have shown that there are two main types of nerve endings that detect touch: those that respond quickly but weakly to repeated touches, and others that react strongly to fast taps but not to sustained pressure. In this study, researchers used computer models to simulate the activity of these nerves and compare it to what was observed in the brains of monkey's somatosensitive cortices. They found that the first type of nerve ending influenced how strong the brain's response was to touch, while the second type affected when the brain responded. Overall, their findings suggest that the brain combines information from both types of nerves in order to effectively perceive touch. By understanding more about how our brains process tactile information, we may gain insights into conditions like numbness or insensitivity to pain caused by damage to specific nerve end types. Additionally, this knowledge could help inform the development of artificial limbs or robots that can better mimic human-like touch sensitivity. It also helps us understand how the brain integrates information from different sources to make decisions and perform tasks. Finally, they discovered that the nervous system uses an efficient method to integrate information from various inputs."
"Unlike other cells in the body , brain cells contain almost no energy reserves and rely on blood vessels for continuous supply of oxygen . A change in the brain’s activity can cause these blood vessels to either dilate or constrict , which alters the supply to match the change in demand . However , it is not known which signals cause these changes in the blood vessels . Previous studies have shown that individual blood vessels in an intact brain tend to dilate when the brain’s activity increases , and constrict when brain activity is inhibited . However , these studies were based on correlations , and there was no direct evidence that the inhibitory cells cause blood vessels to constrict . Uhlirova , Kılıç et al . now provide such evidence . The experiments made use of mice that had been genetically modified such that the excitatory or inhibitory nerve cells in their brains could be selectively activated by shining a blue light on the brain’s surface . The vessels in the outer millimeter of the gray matter of each mouse’s brain were imaged in detail , both before and after the blue light was used to activate the nerve cells . The experiments reveal that both excitatory and inhibitory nerve cells can cause blood vessels in the brain to dilate . However , blood vessels in the brain will only constrict in response to inhibitory nerve cells . Uhlirova , Kılıç et al . went on to identify a molecule called Neuropeptide Y ( or NPY short ) as a signal that triggers the constriction of the blood vessels . This signaling molecule is released by a specific sub-type of inhibitory nerve cell and it binds to a receptor protein on the brain’s blood vessels to make them constrict . These findings suggest that NPY and its receptor on blood vessels may offer promising targets for drugs to treat diseases of the brain’s blood vessels . Further studies are now needed to identify the signals responsible for the dilation of blood vessels in the brain ."," This study looked at how different types of brain cells respond when they receive messages from other brain cells. They used special light to make certain kinds of brain waves happen, then watched what happened using very small flashes of light. They found out that some brain cells cause blood vessels to get smaller, while others do not have this effect. These cells that can change blood vessel size were called “inhibitory” because they seem to stop or slow down the activity of nearby brain cells, but only after these brain cells had already started working. The authors think that this might explain why sometimes MRI machines show changes in blood flow even if you're just sitting there doing nothing. They also suggest that this could help doctors find ways to treat problems like stroke or high blood pressure. Overall, this was an interesting way to learn more about how our brains work! It would be cool to see pictures of those tiny brain cells so readers know where they are inside your head. Also, it would be nice to hear more details about how all these parts fit together – like exactly which kind of message makes each kind of brain wave happen? And how many times does one little brain cell talk to another before things start changing? Thanks for sharing your findings with us! We look forward to learning more about them soon."
"Many growth factors and hormones instruct cells to act in particular ways – for example , to divide , specialize or migrate – by binding to proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases on the surface of the cell . Receptor tyrosine kinases comprise a region that binds to the signaling molecules outside the cell ( the receptor domain ) and a region that interacts with and modifies other proteins within the cell ( the kinase domain ) . When a growth factor or hormone binds to the receptor domain , the receptor domains of two identical receptor tyrosine kinases form a dimeric complex , bringing the kinase domains close together so that they can activate each other . This activation initiates a long chain of protein-protein interactions that leads to a cellular response . Some mutations that occur in the kinase domain cause the kinase to frequently sample the activated state without needing to bind to a signaling molecule . This can lead to cancer or growth disorders . It is not known how these mutations allow the kinase domain to bypass the control mechanisms that prevent it from activating at the wrong time . Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase in which many disease-causing mutations have been identified in the kinase domain . Chen , Marsiglia et al . have now used the human form of the FGF receptor to investigate how some of these mutations affect kinase structure and activity . The structures of normal and mutant forms of the FGF receptor were determined using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Combining these results with activity data from the diseased receptors revealed four key interdependent sites in the protein that play essential roles in maintaining the receptors in an inhibited state . Disease-causing mutations are generally located in these sites , and take advantage of their interdependence to make the kinase active more frequently , even when the receptor domain is not bound to a signaling molecule . Chen , Marsiglia et al . suggest that these sites may act in the same way in other receptor tyrosine kinases , as these proteins have many similarities in their structures . The findings reveal important regions within the kinase domain that could be targeted by inhibitors to prevent the harmful effects of disease-causing mutations . Future studies will be needed to understand in more detail how interactions between the key sites change the activity of the kinases ."," Scientists have discovered a way to explain how different parts of proteins called ""receptors"" work together to control cell signals. These proteins can be turned off or on depending on what cells need. When they are turned on, it allows certain molecules to enter cells and do things like make more blood vessels grow. However, sometimes these proteins get stuck in the wrong position and don't turn off when they should. This can lead to problems like cancer growing inside cells. To figure out why this happens, scientists looked at the structure of these proteas and found ways to tell which parts were important for turning them on or off. They also used computer models to show how these parts might fit together to help the protein work properly. From their studies, they think they now know how some of these parts work together and hope to find better ways to treat diseases caused by these broken proteins. In the future, scientists may use this knowledge to develop new drugs that could help fix these proteases so they work correctly again. This would allow doctors to give patients the right amount of cell signals they need without getting too much or not enough. It could also help researchers understand how to make new medicines that only affect certain types of cells instead of harming healthy ones."
"Each nerve cell in the brain of a mammal communicates with about 1 , 000 other nerve cells in a complex network . Nerve cells ‘talk’ to each other via structures called synapses that connect the nerve cells together . The number of synapses in the brain is enormous – for example , a human brain contains about one quadrillion synapses . One technique that can be used to look at the synapses in the brain is called 3D electron microscopy . The huge number of synapses in an image makes it impractical for researchers to manually label them . However , current methods that use computers to automatically label synapses work most accurately only on images that are so detailed that they cover only very small volumes of the brain ( much less than 1 cubic millimeter ) . Staffler et al . have now developed a new method , called SynEM , that makes it possible for computers to do all the work of finding the synapses in larger volumes of the brain . Without any input from researchers , SynEM can correctly identify connections between nerve cells 97% of the time , which is far more successful than any other current computer-based approach . Importantly , SynEM also automatically indicates which nerve cells are connected by a given synapse , providing a map of “who talks to whom” across the brain . Together with SynEM , methods that track the cable-like structures ( called neurites ) that nerve cells grow to find other nerve cells are already allowing us to map the communication networks in the brain . In the far future Staffler et al . hope that such mappings will become so routine that entire human brains could be studied , perhaps to investigate how diseases affect them ."," Scientists have found that there are many more connections (called synapsis) than previously thought in our brains. This makes it difficult to map all these connections using traditional methods because they require too much time and effort. To solve this problem, scientists developed a new way called ""SynEMAutomated"" (shortened as ""SynaEM"") to detect these connections automatically. Using this new tool, researchers can now analyze larger amounts of brain tissue without having to manually identify each connection by hand. This will help them better understand how different parts of the brain work together. Additionally, SynaEM could potentially be used to study other types of cells that form similar connections. Overall, SynEMAuto is a powerful new tool that will greatly improve our understanding of complex biological systems like the human brain. However, further studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness in real-world applications. For example, future research should test whether SynaAuto works well with different types of images and cell structures. They should also investigate if it can accurately distinguish between healthy and diseased tissues. If successful, SynEM Auto would represent a major advancement in our ability to study complex biological networks. It could lead to breakthroughs in fields such as neuroscience, cancer biology, and immunology."
"Most people sleep for around seven or eight hours at night , but if there is something important or interesting to do – for example , taking care of a baby , finishing a task before a deadline , or watching an entertaining movie – we may stay up late . In other words , sleep is regulated by motivational states . The drive to sleep accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep . Thus sleep and other motivational drives compete to decide whether we sleep or engage in other important or interesting activities . The idea that sleep and sex drives might compete with each other is intuitive , but had not been studied experimentally . Machado , Afonso et al . have now studied how this competition determines the behavior of male fruit flies . The presence of a female fly usually keeps a male fly awake at night . However , a male that has recently mated several times ( and has low sex drive ) or one that was sleep deprived ( and has high sleep drive ) ignores the female and goes to sleep . Further investigation revealed a small number of previously unknown neurons ( termed MS1 ) are required for sexual arousal to overcome the male’s desire to sleep . These neurons do not belong to a circuit that is known to be important for male sexual behavior , but they do communicate with that circuit using a neurotransmitter called octopamine . This communication suppresses sleep and promotes courtship . The next steps will be to identify the specific neurons that communicate directly with the MS1 neurons and to determine whether MS1 neurons have a direct role in regulating sex drive . Investigating these details will help us to understand more generally how competing drives influence behavioral choices ."," In this study, researchers found out how some brain cells called ""MS1"" help control sleep in men. They also learned about another type of cell called ""FRU,"" which helps control sexual desire in both men and women. These two types of cells work together to make sure that men don't fall asleep when they have sex on their minds. This finding could be helpful because it shows us more about how our brains decide what behaviors to prioritize. It might even lead to new ways to treat people who struggle with sleeping problems. However, there are still many questions left unanswered, such as exactly how these cells communicate with each other and why only men need this specific mechanism to keep them awake during sex. Further studies will hopefully shed light on those mysteries. Overall, this research provides important insights into the complex relationship between sleep patterns and sexual motivation. By understanding how these processes interact, scientists may be able to develop better treatments for insomnia and improve overall health outcomes. Additionally, this study highlights the importance of further investigating the role of different brain regions and neural pathways in controlling human behavior. With continued research, we may gain valuable knowledge about how various factors influence our daily choices and habits. Ultimately, this information could help us make more informed decisions about our own lives and guide us towards living happier, healthier lifestyles."
"A small number of signaling systems control how an animal develops from a single cell into a complex organism made up of many different cell types . Signals pass back and forth between cells , switching genes on and off to direct the development of tissues and organs . One of these signaling systems , called Notch , is so ancient that it appears in nearly all multicellular organisms . A cell sends a Notch signal using proteins called Delta or Jagged ligands that span membrane of the cell , so that part of the protein sits inside the cell and part remains outside . To change the behavior of another cell , the ligands bind to proteins called Notch receptors that span the membrane of the receiving cell . Mammals have two types of Delta ligand , two types of Jagged ligand and four types of Notch receptor . Cells in different tissues display different combinations of these eight proteins . Two Delta ligands called DLL1 and DLL4 often appear together in developing organisms . Some tissues need both and some only the one or the other . In some cases one ligand can compensate if the other is missing , but in others not . It was not clear why this is , or which parts of the proteins are responsible . Tveriakhina et al . used mouse cells to investigate how DLL1 and DLL4 interact with two Notch receptors , called NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 . The results of these experiments show that while DLL1 can bind and activate both Notch receptors equally , DLL4 prefers to partner with NOTCH1 . To find out which parts of the ligands are responsible for this selectivity , Tveriakhina et al . created hybrid ligands that contained a mixture of regions from DLL1 and DLL4 . These suggest that the different binding preferences depend on parts of the ligands that sit outside cells and that lie outside the known sites of binding contact with the Notch receptors . Further experiments studied mice that had been engineered to produce hybrid ligands as replacements for DLL1 . A hybrid ligand consisting of the part of DLL1 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL4 found inside cells generated Notch signals in the tissue that depended on the activity of DLL1 . However , a hybrid consisting of the part of DLL4 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL1 found inside cells did not , showing that in developing mice the parts that sit outside the cells contribute to the different functions of DLL1 and DLL4 . Overall , the results presented by Tveriakhina et al . show that interactions between specific ligands and receptors play important roles in how mammals develop . Further efforts to understand which parts of the ligands affect selectivity could ultimately allow researchers to develop ways to modify how ligands and receptors interact . Such “molecular engineering” strategies could enable cell responses to be precisely controlled by pairing designer ligand-receptor pairs to develop cell-based therapies ."," In this study, researchers wanted to understand why two proteins called Delta-like 1 (DLL) and Delta-Like 4 (DL) have different functions when they interact with other proteins on cells called Notch receptors. They used several methods including making new versions of these proteins by swapping out parts of them and then testing how well those new versions worked compared to the original ones. Through their experiments, they found that some parts of the proteins were more important than others for determining which Notch protein it would bind to. This suggests that certain parts of these DL proteins help them choose specific Notch proteins to bind to, while other parts don't matter as much. Overall, their findings suggest that there may be multiple ways that proteins can work together or not work together depending on what part of each one is involved. Understanding this could lead to better treatments for diseases caused by problems with these particular proteins working together. For example, if doctors know exactly which parts of each protein need to match perfectly in order for them to work together, they might be able to find drugs that block those interactions and stop harmful effects from happening. This could potentially help treat conditions like cancer where these protections are causing uncontrolled growth of cells."
"Capillaries form branching networks that surround all cells of the body . They allow oxygen and nutrient exchange between blood and tissue , but this is not their only role . Capillaries in the brain form a tight barrier that prevents components carried in the blood from easily reaching the brain compartment . They also detect the activity of neurons and trigger on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain . This role , revealed only recently , depends upon ion channels on the surface of the capillary cells . Active neurons release potassium ions , which open a type of ion channel called Kir2 . 1 that allows potassium inside the cell to flow out . This process is repeated in neighboring capillary cells until it reaches an upstream vessel , where it causes the vessel to relax and increase the blood flow . Kir2 . 1 channels sit astride the membranes of capillary cells , where they can interact with other membrane molecules . One such molecule , called PIP2 , plays several roles in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of cells . It also physically interacts with channels in the membrane , including Kir2 . 1 channels . If PIP2 levels are low , Kir2 . 1 channel activity decreases . Here , Harraz et al . discovered that capillary cells contain another type of ion channel , called TRPV4 , which is also regulated by PIP2 . But unlike Kir2 . 1 , its activity increases when PIP2 levels drop . Moreover , TRPV4 channels allow sodium and calcium ions to flow into the cell , which has an effect opposite to that of potassium flowing out of the cell . Capillary cells also have receptor proteins called GqPCRs that are activated by chemical signals released by active neurons in the brain . GqPCRs break down PIP2 , so their activity turns Kir2 . 1 channels off and TRPV4 channels on . This resets the system so that it is ready to respond to new signals from active neurons . GqPCRs work as molecular switches to control the balance between Kir2 . 1 and TRPV4 channels and turn brain blood flow up and down . GqPCRs and ion channels that depend on PIP2 can also be found in other types of cells . These findings could reveal clues about how signals are switched on and off in different cells . Understanding the role of PIP2 in signaling could also unveil what happens when signaling go wrong ."," This study found that there was a type of protein called TRP Vanilla 4 (TRVP4) on the surface of special cells called brain capilery endothelium cells (cEC). It also showed that this protein had a function which could be controlled by another kind of protein named Phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P2 (PI(4)PIP(2)). When these proteins were not working well together, it led to problems with how much water moves into or out of the brain. However, when these two proteins worked properly together, they helped keep the right amount of water moving into the brain so that everything would work normally. In addition, this study suggested that some chemicals from other parts of the body might help make sure that these proteons worked correctly together. If this idea turns out to be true, then scientists may have discovered a way to better understand why certain things happen during headaches or migraines. They may also find ways to treat those conditions more effectively. Overall, this finding has important implications for understanding how our brains work and how to take care of them. Further studies will need to confirm whether these results can actually help people who suffer from headaches. More research should be done before any conclusions about treatment options can be made."
"Animals often sniff each other as a form of greeting to communicate with each other through chemical signals in their body odors . However , in humans this form of behavior is considered taboo , especially between strangers . Scientists argue that , in spite of our efforts to avoid being ‘smelly’ , we may actually smell each other without being aware that we do so . Here , Frumin et al . first put on latex gloves and then shook hands with volunteers to collect samples of their odor . Chemical analysis of the gloves found that a handshake alone was sufficient to transfer the volunteers' odor . These odors were made of chemicals that are similar to ones that animals smell when sniffing each other . Therefore , when we shake hands with a stranger , it is possible that we may inadvertently smell the stranger's chemical signals . To address this possibility , Frumin et al . investigated how humans behave after shaking hands with a stranger . Volunteers were asked to wait in a room alone before they were greeted by one of the researchers . Some of these volunteers were greeted with a handshake and others were greeted without a handshake . Afterwards , all the volunteers spent some time in a room by themselves where their behavior was covertly monitored . Frumin et al . found that volunteers who shook hands were more likely to sniff their hand , for example , by touching their nose when they were in the room on their own , than those who did not shake hands . After the volunteers shook hands with someone of their own gender , they spent more time sniffing their right hand ( the one they had used for the handshake ) . However , after the volunteers shook hands with someone of the opposite gender , they spent more time sniffing their left hand instead . Next , the body odor of some of the experimenters was tainted by perfumes or gender-specific odors . Volunteers who shook hands with these tainted individuals behaved differently; when the experimenter was tainted with perfume the volunteers spent more time sniffing their own hands , but when the experimenter was tainted with a gender-specific odor they spent less time sniffing of their own hands . This shows that different smells influenced the hand sniffing behavior of the volunteers . Frumin et al . 's findings suggest that a simple handshake may help us to detect chemical signals from other people . Depending on the person's gender , we may respond by sniffing our right hand to check out the person's odor , or our left hand to smell ourselves in comparison . Future studies will involve finding out how this sniffing behavior could work as an unconcious form of human communication ."," This study looked at something called ""social chemosensing"" between people. Social chemosensors are things like pheromones (chemicals) that help us communicate with others around us. For example, some animals use these chemicals through scent glands on their bodies to signal danger, attract mates, or mark territory. It's not known if humans have similar ways of communicating using chemical signals. Handshakes might be an example of this kind of communication because they involve touching someone else's body. However, it's also possible that people just shake hands automatically when saying hello. So, the researchers wanted to know if there was any evidence that people were consciously trying to pick up other people's chemical smells during a handshaked. They did this by having volunteers participate in a controlled experiment where they shook hands with different kinds of people. Some of them shook hands only with men or women, while others shook hands both across and within genders. During the handshake, half of the volunteers were asked to try to smell the person's hand. Then, the scientists measured how many times the volunteers lifted their nose towards their own hand after the handshake. If the volunteers had been trying to smell their own sweaty hand, then they should lift their noses up much higher than normal."
"Proteins , the molecules that make up the cells’ internal machinery , are responsible for almost every process that keeps cells alive . Watching how proteins move and interact within a living cell can help scientists to better understand these biological mechanisms . Single-particle tracking is a recent technique that makes these observations possible by taking ‘live’ recordings of individual proteins in a cell . Typically , the goal of a single-particle tracking experiment is to assign proteins into groups , or subpopulations , based on the way they move in the cell . For example , one subpopulation may be bound to other cellular structures , a second moving freely at a high speed , and a third diffusing slowly . This informs on the biological roles of the proteins . The method involves an experimental stage and an analysis stage . During the experiment , proteins of interest are labeled with a small dye molecule that produces light when excited by a laser . The laser then illuminates the cell , stimulating all the labels in a thin layer . The position of each molecule is then determined with a microscope and a ‘snapshot’ taken . By repeating this process over multiple images , the movement of each molecule over time can be tracked . However , experimental problems can make the interpretation difficult . Motion blurring takes place when the proteins move so fast they appear as blurs in the images; tracking errors happen when so many proteins are present in the same space their trajectories overlap . Here , Hansen , Woringer et al . combine two pre-existing methods to improve the experimental set-up . Using lasers that flash like a strobe light reduces motion blurring by essentially taking snapshots of the proteins at short time intervals . Tracking errors are addressed by a technique whereby only one protein at a time produces light . Once the images are obtained and analyzed to yield trajectories , the trajectories themselves need to be analyzed to determine the number and properties of the protein subpopulations . Several factors can skew this analysis stage . For example , there is often a bias against fast-moving particles because the laser only lights up a thin layer of the cell . The proteins travelling slowly stay in focus long enough to be detected across many images; the fast ones quickly move out of the layer and are therefore counted less often . Hansen , Woringer et al . designed a free and user-friendly algorithm package called Spot-On to correct for this issue . Spot-On was thoroughly benchmarked against other solutions , demonstrating both its accuracy and robustness . Single-particle tracking can lead to misleading results if used incorrectly . It is essential to publically share solutions that help make this technique more rigorous , especially since a growing number of scientists have already started to use the method ."," Single particle tracking (SPT) is a technique used to study how proteins move inside living cells by following their movements over time. This can tell us about different properties of these proteins such as where they go or how fast they move. Unfortunately, there are many things that make this difficult to do correctly. First, sometimes proteins will leave the field of view, so we need to account for this. Second, sometimes we don't know exactly what kind of movement we are looking at, so again, we need a way to account and correct for this type of error. In this study, the authors developed two new ways to improve our ability to analyze SPT data. They created a tool called ""Spot On"" that helps researchers choose the best parameters for analyzing their data based on the specifics of their experiment. They also came up with a new way to take pictures of proteins that should help reduce some of the errors associated with following the movement of individual particles. By combining these tools, the researchers were able to learn more about how proteasomes move within the nucleus of live cells. Overall, this work shows promise for helping researchers get better results when studying protein behavior in living cells. It also highlights the importance of considering all potential sources of error when designing and analyzing SPT experiments."
"Plants have an internal time keeper known as the circadian clock that operates in 24-hour cycles to coordinate the plants behaviors with the environment . The clock is made of many different proteins and plants carefully control when they make and destroy these proteins to regulate the cycle . Inside plant cells , enzymes known as E3 ubiquitin ligases determine which proteins are destroyed by labelling target proteins with a small tag . Plants have hundreds of different E3 ubiquitin ligases , leading to overlaps in the roles the different enzymes play . These overlaps make it difficult to identify the specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that are involved in a particular process . As a result , only few E3 ubiquitin ligases implicated in the circadian clock have been identified so far . A small weed known as Arabidopsis is often used in research studies because it grows quickly and the genes can be easily manipulated . Here , Feke et al . set out to develop a new tool to identify the specific E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in regulating the circadian clock in Arabidopsis . The team created a library of hundreds of Arabidopsis plants producing different decoy E3 ubiquitin ligases that retained their ability to bind to target proteins but were unable to degrade them . Nearly a quarter of the E3 ligases found in Arabidopsis were represented in this library . The decoy enzymes protected the target proteins from being degraded by the normal E3 ubiquitin ligases , resulting in the library plants having presumably higher levels of these target proteins compared to normal Arabidopsis plants . By tracking circadian rhythms in these plants , the team was able to identify the individual E3 ligases that control the circadian clock . The experiments revealed several E3 ligases that may regulate the circadian clock , including two enzymes called MAC3A and MAC3B . Further experiments demonstrated that MAC3A and MAC3B have similar roles in regulating the circadian clock and can compensate for the absence of the other . The library of Arabidopsis plants generated by Feke et al . is now available for other researchers to use in their studies . In the future this approach could be adapted to make similar libraries for crops and other plants that have even more E3 ligase enzymes than Arabidopsis ."," Scientists have found that some proteins need to be broken down every day so that our body can keep its natural rhythms. However, scientists do not know which specific proteins break them down. They also don't know how many different ways there are to break these proteins down. So, they came up with an idea called ""decoys"" - fake versions of the proteins that get broken down. By using these decoysis, they could tell which proteins were important for breaking other proteins. Using this technique, they discovered 24 more proteins involved in breaking down proteins related to our daily rhyhtms! These findings will help us learn even more about why it is important to sleep at night or exercise during the day. It also shows us that sometimes, things aren't always what they seem - just like when you see your parents sleeping but they say they're awake! Sometimes, they might actually be doing something else entirely! Just like humans, plants use proteins all the time to make sure everything works right. And now, thanks to these special ""decyos,"" we can find out exactly which ones are most important. That way, maybe one day we can figure out better ways to help people stay healthy and happy throughout the whole day."
"It takes an army of immune cells to defend the body against infection . But sometimes the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks its own cells and chronic inflammatory conditions develop . In multiple sclerosis – also known as “MS” – a horde of immune cells infiltrate the brain and spinal cord , forming lesions which strip nerve cells of their insultation , a protective fatty material called myelin . Nerve cells become damaged , scarred and exposed , and this interferes with messages between the brain and other parts of the body . Advanced imaging techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by capturing lesions as they develop in the brain and spinal cord . Researchers have also focused their efforts on understanding how immune cells activated in the blood stream invade the central nervous system . To better understand how a mistaken immune response leads to nerve damage in multiple sclerosis , a forensic examination of which immune cells accumulate in brain tissue to form lesions is needed . Standard techniques for analyzing whole tissue samples are however limited by design , capable of detecting only a few cell markers in one section of tissue . Ramaglia et al . have now validated a new imaging technique for looking at an array of cell types in brain tissue in a single sample . The technique – called imaging mass cytometry ( or IMC for short ) – was used to look at post-mortem brain tissue from a multiple sclerosis patient with an acute form of the illness . The tissue examined had multiple sclerosis lesions present . Different types of immune cells were simultaneously identified and characterized using a panel of antibodies which recognize the signature proteins each immune cell makes when active . The state of the underlying myelin content of the tissue was also characterized . The imaging approach could distinguish between the immune cells of the brain ( known as resident microglia ) and a type of white blood cell summoned as part of the immune response ( infiltrating macrophages ) . The analysis showed that , in the particular patient examined , microglia are abundant in active lesions in multiple sclerosis; also , different subsets of white blood cells were detected . Measuring how far different immune cells had migrated from nearby blood vessels added insights as to how immune cells move through the brain and which cells may have arrived first . Altogether , Ramaglia et al . have shown that IMC can be used as a discovery tool to gain a deeper understanding of multiple sclerosis lesions and immune cells active in the inflamed brain . Further work will apply this now validated imaging approach to large cohorts of multiple sclerosis patients ."," Multiple Scleroris (MS) is a condition where there are areas of damage in the central nervous system due to an autoimmune response against myelin sheaths surrounding nerve fibers. These damaged areas are called plaques or lesions. In this study, researchers wanted to understand more about these lesions using a technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry. They chose a person who had stopped taking a medication called Natalizumeb because it was not working anymore. By looking at many different kinds of cells and what they were doing inside the lesions, the researchers found out some important things. First, they could tell apart two different kinds or populations of macrophage cells. Second, they learned which kind of lymeophcyte cells were close to blood vessells. Third, they saw that there were several different kinds, or subtypes, of T cells and B cell. Finally, they figured out how each subtype of T or B cell behaved differently depending on whether the lesion was active or inactive. This new way of studying cells can help doctors learn more about how different kinds and subtypes of cells work together during MS attacks. It may also be helpful for figuring out better ways to treat people with MS."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( or COPD ) is a serious condition that causes the lungs to become inflamed for long periods of time , leading to permanent damage of the airways . Immune cells known as neutrophils promote inflammation after an injury , or during an infection , to aid the healing process . However , if they are active for too long , they may also cause tissue damage and drive inflammatory diseases including COPD . To limit damage to the body , neutrophils usually have a very short lifespan and die by a regulated process known as apoptosis . Finding ways to stimulate apoptosis in neutrophils may be key to developing better treatments for inflammatory diseases . Cells contain many enzymes known as kinases that control apoptosis and other cell processes . Drugs that inhibit specific kinases are effective treatments for some types of cancer and other conditions , and new kinase-inhibiting drugs are currently being developed . However , it remains unclear which kinases regulate apoptosis in neutrophils or which kinase-inhibiting drugs may have the potential to treat COPD and other inflammatory diseases . To address these questions , Rahman et al . tested over 350 kinase-inhibiting drugs to identify ones that promote apoptosis in neutrophils . The experiments showed that human neutrophils treated with drugs that inhibit the ErbB family of kinases died by apoptosis more quickly than untreated neutrophils . Next , Rahman et al . used zebrafish with injured tail fins as models to study inflammation . Zebrafish treated with one of these drugs – known as Tyrphostin AG825 – had lower levels of inflammation and their neutrophils underwent apoptosis more frequently than untreated zebrafish . Since drugs can have off-target effects , Rahman et al . went on to show using gene-editing technology that reducing the activity of two genes that encode ErbB kinases in zebrafish also decreased the levels of inflammation in the fish . Further experiments used mice that develop inflammation in the lungs similar to COPD in humans . As expected , neutrophils in the lungs of mice treated with Tyrphostin AG825 underwent apoptosis more frequently than those in untreated mice . These dead neutrophils were effectively cleared by other immune cells called macrophages , which also helps limit damage caused by neutrophils . Together , these findings show that Tyrphostin AG825 and other drugs that inhibit ErbB kinases help to reduce inflammation by promoting the death of neutrophils . Since several of these drugs are already used to treat human cancers , it may be possible in the future to repurpose them for use in people with COPD and other long-term inflammatory diseases . Determining whether this is possible is an aim for future studies ."," This study found that certain drugs called ""ErbB"" inhibitor drugs can help speed up the process of getting rid of harmful white blood cells called ""neutrophiles"". These types of cells often build up during an infection or other type of inflammations. They did this experiment using different ways like testing it on fish and mice. They even tested it on human cells taken from people who had a condition called ""COPD"", which causes problems with breathing due to long term smoking or exposure to air pollution. Overall, they showed that these Erb B inhibitor drug could be helpful in treating some diseases where there is too much of these white blood cell around. However, more studies need to be done before we know if these drugs would actually be safe enough to use in humans. For example, researchers should test them on animals first to see how well they work and what side effects might happen. If those look good, then maybe doctors will start prescribing them to patients suffering from certain medical conditions. But again, only after lots more tests and experiments! In short, scientists discovered new medicines that may help treat illnesses caused by too many special kinds of germs inside our bodies. More research needs to be conducted before we can tell whether these treatments are safe and effective enough for regular use."
"Much of what happens in biology occurs at scales so small that the microscopy methods traditionally used by biologists cannot visualize them . One such process is bacterial sporulation: in stressful conditions , bacteria like Bacillus subtilis can divide to produce a smaller cell called a forespore , which the larger mother cell then engulfs . The forespore matures into a hardy spore , which is able to survive in harsh environments and only transform into an active bacterium when conditions improve . Bacterial cells are surrounded by a stiff layer of a material called peptidoglycan . This wall sits outside of the bacterium’s thin flexible membrane and determines the bacterium’s shape . At the beginning of sporulation , the forespore is separated from the mother cell by a peptidoglycan wall . Engulfment of the spore by the mother cell requires a dramatic change in the shape of this partition . Microbiologists had thought that all the rigid peptidoglycan must be degraded to allow the partition to deform flexibly during engulfment; however , no one had yet observed the tiny structures involved . Khanna et al . directly visualized sporulation in B . subtilis using a technique called cryo-electron tomography ( or cryo-ET for short ) . In cryo-ET , samples are cooled to low temperatures and then imaged with a beam of electrons . Cryo-ET requires thin samples , thinner even than most bacteria . By combing cryo-ET with another methodology that allowed them to focus in on thin sections of their sample , Khanna et al . generated high resolution images , which provided a look at forespore engulfment in unprecedented detail . These images revealed that the peptidoglycan wall separating the mother cell from forespore is not completely degraded: a thin layer of peptidoglycan persists . Comparing these images to cryo-ET images of cells treated with drugs that block the production of peptidoglycan suggested a new engulfment mechanism . This includes a cycle of peptidoglycan production and degradation that accompanies the advancing mother cell membrane as it surrounds the forespore during engulfment . Khanna et al . could also see that the mother cell’s membrane formed finger-like projections as it moved around the forespore , something that was not visible with previous techniques . This detailed engulfment mechanism is an important advance in the understanding of bacterial spore formation . Additionally , Khanna et al . have generated a collection of images , methods and analyses that may prove useful to a wide community of biologists attempting to understand sporulation and other fundamental processes that occur on a small scale ."," Scientists have used special microscopes to take pictures of bacteria called Bacilus subtills while they were making a ""seed"" inside them. They could see how the bacteria made this seed, which was like a little egg inside the mommy bacteria. To make the egg, the bacteria had to divide into two parts, one big part and one small part. When dividing, the momma bacteria left some food behind for the baby egg. But instead of leaving all the food, they just left enough so the baby would be able to eat it later when she hatches out of her egg. This leftover food was kind of sticky and hard because it was made up of lots of pieces of food stuck together. After the mom mycobacteria left all the extra food behind, then they wrapped the baby eggs up really tight with more food from outside the walls of the mom's body. It took a long time for the babies to hatch out of their eggs, but once they did, they were ready to grow up and play! So basically, these scientists figured out how the mom bacteria feed their babies before they hatch. And now we know why the mommies leave some food for their babies to eat after they split apart."
"New treatments are tested in clinical trials before they are licensed for use in patients , but until the drugs are available for prescribing it’s not always possible to identify every side effect . When the drugs enter the clinic , they might be prescribed to patients with multiple medical conditions , or combined with other treatments . The drugs may also be taken for longer periods of time than tested in trials . It is therefore common for new adverse reactions to emerge after a drug is in widespread use . The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System ( FAERS ) is a surveillance system used in the United States for reporting drug side effects after new treatments have been licensed . Healthcare professionals and patients can submit reports to the database , logging the adverse drug reactions that they have experienced . FAERS currently contains over 8 . 5 million entries , and is growing all the time . However , Maciejewski et al . show that the database has several shortcomings that are reducing its usefulness . For instance , on average any given drug will have 16 different names in the system; this makes it challenging to group all of the reported side effects so that trends and patterns can be correctly seen . To address this first problem , Maciejewski et al . grouped together drugs according to their active ingredients , rather than their name . This made it much easier to account for subsequent , and more crucial conflating factors such as multiple reports for the same adverse event and patient , or cases where adverse reactions were confused with the diseases that the drugs are trying to treat . For example , diabetes was listed as a side effect for drugs used to treat diabetes . Building on this cleaned-up dataset , Maciejewski et al . monitored how adverse event signals evolve over time and uncovered biases that were hard to see otherwise . For example , side-effects were reported more often when drugs were in the news . More strikingly , this bias affected not only the drug in question , but also other drugs that acted in the same way or on the same molecular target . The computational method developed by Maciejewski et al . allows the data in FAERS to be combined and corrected , making easier to evaluate the safety of different medicines . The link between adverse side effects and the molecular targets of the drug , via the ingredient’s chemical structure , furthermore makes it possible to analyze such clinical data reliably by using chemical and genetic information . In the future , this method could also help to identify previously unknown side effects and the biological mechanisms behind them . This could help researchers to develop new drugs with improved side effect profiles ."," In this study, researchers analyzed data from the FDA's database called FAERS, which contains information about side effects that occur after taking certain medications. This database has some issues such as inconsistent formatting, errors, and duplicate entries. Therefore, the researchers first fixed those issues by mapping drugs to chemicals and using natural language techniques to analyze the text of each entry. They found examples where the same side effect was listed multiple times or where it seemed like the side effect happened because of the medical condition being treated rather than the medication. They also showed how different types of side effects could be linked together based on what they know about them. Overall, the study shows that there are many ways to improve the quality of databases like FAERS so that they can provide more useful information to help doctors make better decisions about treating patients. It also suggests new ways to use this kind of data to learn more about how medicines work and why they sometimes cause unexpected reactions. These findings will hopefully lead to safer and more effective treatments for people who need them. 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009468.t001Table 2Summary of results for three drugs.DrugMethylphe-nidatemapAripi-prazolemapRisperi-donenot mapADR profilePsychosis, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, dry mouth, constipation, tachycardia, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, aggression, depression, hallucinations, delusions, psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, mania, impulse control disorders, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, self-harm behavior, obsessive compulsive disorder, akathisia, restlessness, withdrawal syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, hyperprolactinemia, galactorrhoea, amenorrhea, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, libido change, sexual dysfunctionPsychiatric disturbances, movement disorders, cardiovascular effects, metabolic effects, gastrointestinal effects, other effectsSchizophrena, psychosis, mood swings, irritability, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, appetite changes, weight gain or loss, tremors, muscle spasms, stiffness, pain"
"The human brain is ever changing , constantly rewiring itself in response to new experiences , knowledge or information from the environment . Addictive drugs such as cocaine can hijack the genetic mechanisms responsible for this plasticity , creating dangerous , obsessive drug-seeking and consuming behaviors . Cocaine-induced plasticity is difficult to apprehend , however , as brain regions or even cell populations can react differently to the compound . For instance , sub-regions in the striatum – the brain area that responds to rewards and helps to plan movement – show distinct responses during progressive exposure to cocaine . And while researchers know that the drug immediately changes how neurons switch certain genes on and off , it is still unclear how these genetic modifications later affect behavior . Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . explored these questions at different scales , first focusing on how progressive cocaine exposure changed the way various gene programs were activated across the entire brain . This revealed that programs in the striatum were the most affected by the drug . Examining this region more closely showed that cocaine switches on genes in specific ‘spiny projection’ neuron populations , depending on where these cells are located and the drug history of the mouse . Finally , Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . used genetically modified mice to piece together cocaine exposure , genetic changes and modifications in behavior . These experiments revealed that the drive to seek cocaine depended on activation of the Egr2 gene in populations of spiny projection neurons in a specific sub-region of the striatum . The gene , which codes for a protein that regulates how genes are switched on and off , was itself strongly activated by cocaine intake . Cocaine addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals . Grasping how this drug alters the brain could pave the way for new treatments , while also providing information on the basic mechanisms underlying brain plasticity ."," Drug addiction occurs when certain parts of the brain change because of long-term exposure to drugs. These changes happen slowly over time and involve many different areas of the brains. One way scientists can study these changes is by looking at what happens inside the brain after someone takes a dose of the drug. This gives them an idea of where in the brain the drug may be causing problems. Scientists have found that one particular part of the mouse brain called the “ventrolateral” area of the “striatum” shows some changes after they take several doses of cocain. They also know that another protein called “Egr 2” is turned on (or induced) in this same part of their brain. In order to see if turning on Egr 1 has anything to do with the changes caused by taking cocaine, researchers used special tools to turn off Egr1 so that it could not be turned on. Then they looked to see whether or not the changes normally seen in the mouse’s brain were still there. If they were, then it would mean that Egrl was important for those changes happening. However, if the changes disappeared, then that would suggest that EGRl was necessary for those brain changes to occur. Fortunately, the researchers had a tool that allowed them to look directly into the mouse's brain while they were awake and moving around. By doing this, they could tell whether or"
"Neurons transmit information using electrical activity . Whereas electrical currents in wires consist of moving electrons , those in neurons are made up of charged particles called ions . These flow into and out of the cells through specialized channels in the outer membrane . Changes in ion channels can disrupt brain activity . However , unravelling the interactions between molecules that give rise to particular behaviours or diseases is challenging in living animals . Computer models can simplify this task , but only if the models are accurate copies of living systems . It is never possible to obtain a completely accurate model , so instead the goal is to make sure that any understanding derived from the models can guide new experiments , and that models are refined appropriately based on the results of these new experiments . Sekulić and Skinner used computer modelling to explore how ion channels affect the properties of a type of neuron called the oriens lacunosum/moleculare ( O-LM ) cell . These are found in a region of the brain called the hippocampus , which is involved in learning and memory . When animals explore their environment , the O-LM cells fire in synchrony with other cells in the hippocampus . Hippocampal cell populations typically fire either between 4 and 7 times per second , known as low theta , or 7 to 12 times per second , called high theta . Low theta firing supports the processing of emotions , whereas high theta helps animals form a mental map of their surroundings . Sekulić and Skinner wanted to know how the distribution of ion channels in O-LM cells – particularly a subtype called h-channels – affects whether the cells take part in theta firing . The task was made possible by the availability of a database of computer models of O-LM cells , each featuring a different distribution of ion channels . Sekulić and Skinner exposed each model to patterns of activity simulating those in the brain of an animal exploring its environment . The results revealed that specific combinations and distributions of ion channels predispose , or “tune” , O-LM cells to participate in either low or high theta , and thus emotional or spatial learning in the hippocampus . The next step is to test the predictions of the models experimentally . Studies should examine whether the distribution of ion channels in O-LM cells does indeed predispose them to fire at particular frequencies , as the models suggest . A further question is how targeting O-LM cells in freely moving animals would affect spatial and emotional memory ."," Researchers have developed computer simulations of brain cells called ""O-LM"" cells. These cells help control what information gets through in the brain. They do this by only letting certain kinds of signals pass through them at certain times. In order to make sure they let signals through at the right time, these cells need to know exactly when other parts of the brain are sending out those signals. To figure out how well the computer simulations match up with real O-LMs, researchers tested them using different patterns of timing from other parts. They found that some patterns made the simulated cell respond more often during one kind of signal than another pattern did. By changing just one thing about the simulation, like adding special proteins that change how the cell responds to signals, the researchers could switch which pattern caused the most response. This shows us that we might be able to use these proteins to help control whether or not an O-lm cell lets certain signals through. That way, we might eventually be able use them to help treat diseases where there are problems controlling what information goes between different parts of your brain. For example, if someone has trouble making decisions because too much information is getting through, we could block off some pathways so less information is going through. On the other hand, if you're having trouble remembering things, maybe we could open up some pathway so more information would get through."
"Bacteria and viruses have long been fighting amongst themselves . Bacteriophages are a type of virus that invade bacteria; their name literally means ‘bacteria eater’ . The bacteriophage T7 , for example , infects the common bacteria known as Escherichia coli . Once inside , the virus hijacks the bacterium’s cellular machinery , using it to replicate its own genetic material and make more copies of the virus so it can spread . At the same time , the bacteria have found ways to try and defend themselves , which in turn has led some bacteriophages to develop countermeasures to overcome those defences . Many bacteria , for example , have restriction enzymes which recognise certain sections of the bacteriophage DNA and cut it into fragments . However , the T7 bacteriophage has one well-known protein called Ocr which inhibits restriction enzymes . Ocr does this by mimicking DNA , which led Ye et al . to wonder if it could also interrupt other vital processes in a bacterial cell that involve DNA . Transcription is the first step in a coordinated process that turns the genetic information stored in a cell’s DNA into useful proteins . An enzyme called RNA polymerase decodes the DNA sequence into a go-between molecule called messenger RNA , and it was here that Ye et al . thought Ocr might jump in to interfere . To begin , Ye et al . examined the structure of Ocr when it binds to RNA polymerase using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy . Ocr has been well-studied before , its structure previously described , but not when attached to RNA polymerase . The analysis showed that Ocr gets in the way of specific molecules , called sigma factors , that show RNA polymerase where to start transcription . Ocr binds to RNA polymerase in exactly the same pocket as part of sigma factors do , which is also the place where DNA must be to be decoded to make messenger RNA . Ye et al . then performed experiments to show Ocr interfering with binding to RNA polymerase did indeed disrupt transcription . This means Ocr is quite versatile as it interferes with the RNA polymerase of the bacterial host and its restriction enzymes . Ocr’s strategy of mimicking DNA to interrupt transcription could be adopted as an approach to develop new antibiotics to stop bacterial infections . DNA transcription is an essential cellular process – without it , no cell can replicate and survive – and RNA polymerase is already a validated target for drugs . Following Ocr’s lead could provide a new way to stop infections , if the right drug can be designed to fit ."," Scientists have discovered a new way that bacteria fight back against phages. Phages are tiny viruses that attack and kill bacteria. To protect themselves from being attacked, some types of bacteria use special proteins called restriction endonucleases or REs. These proteins cut up any foreign DNA that enters their cells. But certain kinds of phages, like those found on Bacillus, can fool these proteins because they carry another kind of protein called Ocr. This protein looks just like DNA and tricks the bacteria into thinking it belongs there. So instead of cutting up the phage's DNA, the bacteria let it take over and make copies of itself. Now scientists have figured out how this trick works at the molecular level. They know exactly which parts of the virus protein fit together like pieces of a puzzle to form a structure that resembles DNA. And they know that this structure helps the virus avoid getting destroyed by the bacteria's defense mechanisms. By understanding more about how these viruses work, researchers might be able to develop better ways to treat bacterial infections. For example, they could design drugs that target specific molecules involved in the process. That would help stop the infection without harming our own bodies. It's all about finding the right piece of the puzzle!"
"Nearly all animals sleep more while they are still developing , suggesting that sleep is important in early life . Previous studies have shown that sleep may be required for building connections in the brain . However , it has been difficult to study the effects of sleep in earlier stages of brain development , when stem cells divide to create brain cells in a process known as “neurogenesis” . This is partly because , in mammals , most neurogenesis occurs in the womb . Scientists have successfully studied sleep using the common fruit fly . But these studies have so far focused on adult flies , in which neurogenesis is mostly complete . Fly larvae , on the other hand , are widely used to study brain development and neurogenesis . Compared to mammals in the womb , fruit fly larvae are very easy to access and manipulate . However , unlike adult flies , no one had previously looked to see if larvae even display a behaviour that would fit the definition of sleep . To see if fruit fly larvae do sleep , Szuperak et al . created the “LarvaLodge” , an apparatus in which individual larvae can be housed while having their activity monitored over time . In these lodges , a bright light was used to test how hard it is to arouse inactive fruit fly larvae , and further experiments asked what happens when larvae are prevented from resting . Then , to look at neurogenesis in the larvae , Szuperak et al . used a stain that labels dividing stem cells within the nervous system . Those cells could then be seen and counted when a larva was dissected and examined under a microscope . The results from the LarvaLodge showed that fruit fly larvae do indeed sleep: they have extended periods of rest during which they react less to outside disturbances and adopt a particular posture ( they retract their heads towards their bodies ) . Also when larvae were deprived of sleep , by shining a light or shaking , they compensated by sleeping more afterwards . Importantly , depriving the larvae of sleep also led to lower levels of neurogenesis . These findings establish the fruit fly larva as a new and useful system for studying the role of sleep in early development , and may help shed light on the role sleep plays in disorders affecting brain development ."," Sleep plays an important role in our lives by helping us feel rested and refreshed. It also helps regulate many bodily functions such as growth and repair. Scientists have found that some animals like flies can fall asleep at different times throughout their lifespan. In this study, scientists discovered that these fly babies (called larve) could fall into two types of sleeps called active or quiet sleep. They also found that a type of hormone called octopaminergic neuromediator was responsible for waking up the baby flies while another hormone, dopamine, did not play a role. Interestingly, they found that if they kept the baby fly awake using special equipment, it would affect how well the baby’s brain grew. These findings show that even very young creatures need to rest and that there may be different ways that hormones help control sleep than what we know about in adults. By learning more about how sleep affects growing brains, researchers might better understand why humans need to sleep and how much sleep is needed at each age. This knowledge could then lead to new ideas on how to treat problems related to lack of sleep in children. For example, doctors might recommend extra nap time after staying up late at night. Or maybe playing music or other sounds that wake up sleeping babies could be used to help them catch up on lost sleep."
"We communicate with each other using speech , writing and physical gestures . But how do bacteria , yeast and other single-celled microbes communicate ? In 2014 , researchers reported a new example of communication between bacteria and yeast in which the bacteria send a chemical message that has a very long-lasting effect on how the yeast grow in certain environments . This in turn also affected the ability of the bacteria to survive in these environments . The identity of the chemical message produced by the bacteria , however , was not known . Garcia , Dietrich et al . – including one of the researchers from the previous study – used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the chemical message . The experiments show that the message is a molecule called lactic acid , which is very common in nature and is produced by many bacteria . Garcia , Dietrich et al . found out how much lactic acid is needed to alter the growth of brewer’s yeast , and which genes in yeast are involved in responding to the message from the bacteria . Further experiments suggest that the ability of yeast and bacteria to communicate using lactic acid is likely to have existed for hundreds of millions of years . The next step following this work will be to identify other chemical messages used by microbes . The human body is packed with billions of bacterial cells , and in some cases yeast can also take up residence . A future challenge will be to find out if bacteria and yeast inside the human body are able to communicate with each other in ways that could affect our health ."," Scientists have found that some types of bacteria can help yeasts overcome their natural tendency to use only one type of food (glucose) to survive. They do this through a special way of storing proteins called ""prions"". These prions allow yeasts to eat different foods at once instead of just glucoses. Now scientists know that these helpful bacteria produce something called ""lactic acid"" that helps yeasts get rid of their glucosis addiction and start eating all kinds of foods they want. It's like having your own personal chef who cooks whatever you want whenever you want it! But unlike humans, yeasts don't get fat because they turn everything into energy right away. Cool, huh? And this works even if the yeasts are really far away from where the bacteria were, so maybe they could still help us out somehow. That would be awesome! Just imagine if you could tell your body to stop being picky about what it eats when you're sick or hungry. Wouldn't that be great? Science rules! 👨‍🎓🔬💡🧫 #science #yeast #bacteria #foodie #prion"
"A DNA double helix is made up of two DNA strands , which in turn are made of molecules that are each known by a single letter—A , T , C , or G . The sequence of these ‘letters’ in each DNA strand contains biological information . Genes are sections of DNA that can be ‘expressed’ to produce proteins and RNA molecules . To express a gene , the DNA strands in the double helix must first be partially separated so that one of them can be used as a template to build an RNA molecule in a process called transcription . Either of the DNA strands in a helix can be used as an RNA template , but contain different genes and are read in opposite directions . One of the two strands is called the ‘sense’ strand , the other the ‘antisense’ strand . The RNA molecule does not transcribe a whole DNA strand; instead , it transcribes a section of DNA , known as a transcription unit , which contains at least one gene . The end of a transcription unit is marked by certain signals that stop transcription . However , some transcription units in a DNA strand overlap , so there must be some way that the transcription machinery can sometimes ignore these stop signals . The activity of some genes is linked to the activity of their immediate neighbours . Furthermore , some genes are expressed in different amounts in response to changes in environmental conditions . Researchers have previously suggested that there must be some form of switch that controls when these genes are expressed . Nguyen et al . now engineer start and stop signals at a neighbouring pair of genes , called HMS2 and BAT2 , in yeast . When one gene is switched on , the other is switched off and which gene is active depends on the diet of the yeast cells . On the antisense DNA strand opposite to HMS2 is another gene , SUT650 . Nguyen et al . show that when this gene is transcribed , the transcription of HMS2 on the other DNA strand is blocked . This has the knock-on effect of turning on BAT2 . Conversely , transcribing HMS2 switches off SUT650 and BAT2 because the end of HMS2 overlaps with the beginning of both SUT650 and BAT2 . Switching between different genes relies on loops that physically link the start and stop signals of the gene to be transcribed while ignoring the start and stop signals for neighbouring genes . Proteins called transcription factors can bind to DNA and affect whether a gene is transcribed . Nguyen et al . found that a transcription factor that binds near the start of the HMS2 gene helps to control which DNA strand is transcribed . When transcription factors do not bind to the start of HMS2 , antisense transcription—and the expression of SUT650—occurs instead . Overall , Nguyen et al . show that the transcription process itself makes up part of a switch that can control the expression of several genes on both the sense and antisense strands of a DNA double helix . This may also explain how many other , more complex , gene networks are activated in response to changes in the environment ."," In some organisms like yeasts, there are multiple copies of certain genes next to each other on their DNA. These genes can be turned on together or separately depending on what kind of food they eat. Scientists have known about this type of behavior before, but they didn't know exactly why it happened. To figure out how this happens, scientists used special techniques to look at which parts of the DNA were being copied into RNA molecules as the cells grew. They found that when one set of genes was being expressed more than another set, it meant that the two sets of genes were being transcribed differently. This means that something about the way those genes were written on the DNA was causing them to behave differently. When looking closer at the genes, they saw that sometimes the genes could make either one big RNA or two smaller ones. Depending on whether they made one big one or two small ones, the cells behaved differently. By changing where the genes started copying and where they stopped copying, the scientists showed that making one long RNA caused the first group of genes to turn off and the second group to turn on. On the other hand, if the genes only made two smaller pieces of RNAs, then both groups of genes would stay on. So, the way that the genes are written on DNA affects whether or not they get turned on or off. And because the genes can make either a big piece of RNA that turns off the first set of three genes, or two little pieces of an RNA to keep them on, this shows us that the way the genes work is like a switch that can turn on or turn off."
"How we perceive what we see depends on the context in which we see it , such as what we are doing at the time . For example , we perceive a park landscape differently when we are running through it than when we are sitting on a park bench . Behavior can also alter neuronal responses in the brain . Indeed , the neurons in the part of the brain that receives information related to vision ( known as the visual cortex ) respond differently to visual stimuli when an animal is moving compared to when the animal is still . However , while some recent studies revealed that specific types of neurons become more or less responsive during movement , others reported the opposite results . One hypothesis that would explain these contradictory findings would be if the way that behavior , in this case movement , affects neuronal responses also depends on the external context in which the movement happens . Now , Pakan et al . have tested this hypothesis by imaging the activity of different types of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice that were either running on a treadmill or staying still . The experiments were conducted in two different contexts: in total darkness ( in which the mice could not see ) and in the presence of display screens ( which provided the mice with visual stimulation ) . Pakan et al . confirmed that running does indeed affect the activity of specific neurons in different ways in different contexts . For example , when the mice received visual stimulation , the three main classes of neurons that send inhibitory signals in the visual cortex became more active during running . However , when the mouse ran in the dark , two of these neuron types became more active during running while the third type of neuron was unresponsive . This finding reveals more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity that strongly depends on the animal’s behaviour . It also shows how these neurons influence the excitatory neurons in the visual cortex , which send information to the rest of the brain for further processing towards perception . The next step will be to identify what precise mechanism makes these neurons respond differently in unique contexts , and to tease apart how these movement-dependent signals affect the way animals perceive visual stimuli ."," Scientists used mice to study how different types of brain cells respond when they move around or stay still. They looked at how these cells responded to light flashes when the mice were either moving or not moving. They also studied how these same cells reacted to being moved from dark places into bright ones. Their results suggest that some kinds of brain cell behave differently depending on what kind of light is shining on them and whether the animal is moving or staying still. Overall, their work suggests that there may be more than one way for animals' brains to handle incoming signals from their eyes. It also shows that even very similar looking brain cells can have completely different ways of responding to things like movement or changes in lighting conditions. This could help scientists understand better why people feel dizzy sometimes after quickly going from a dimly lit room into a well-lit one. It might also explain why it takes us a few seconds to adjust to sudden changes in brightness, such as walking outside on a sunny day after being inside all morning. By learning more about how our brains deal with different kinds of sensations coming in at once, researchers hope to find new ways to treat diseases caused by problems with how the brain processes information. For example, understanding more about this process could lead to treatments for motion sickness, which affects many people who travel by plane or boat."
"Putting on a necklace requires using your fingertips to hold open a clasp , which you then insert into a small ring . For you to do this , your nervous system must first work out which way the clasp and the ring are facing relative to one another . It then uses that information to coordinate the movements of your fingertips . If you fasten the necklace behind your head , your nervous system must perform these tasks without information from your eyes . Instead , it must use the way in which the edges of the clasp and the ring indent the skin on your fingertips to work out their orientation . Earlier studies have examined this process by asking healthy volunteers to judge the orientation of objects – or more precisely edges – that an experimenter has pressed against their fingertips . But people perform worse than expected on this task given their manual dexterity . Pruszynski et al . wondered whether the task might underestimate the abilities of the volunteers because it involves passively perceiving objects , rather than actively manipulating them . To test this idea , Pruszynski et al . designed a new experiment . Healthy volunteers were asked to use a fingertip to rotate a pointer on a dial to a target location . The participants could not see the dial , and so they had to use touch alone to determine which way the pointer was facing . They performed the task faster and more accurately than volunteers in the earlier passive experiments . Indeed , when the pointer was longer than a fingertip , the volunteers performed almost as well using touch alone as when allowed to look at the dial . Speed and accuracy remained impressive even when the pointer was only 2mm long . The results of Pruszynski et al . show that we judge orientation more accurately when we manipulate objects than when we passively perceive them . In other words , we do better when we perform tasks in which being aware of orientation is vital . The results also suggest that the nervous system processes sensory information in different ways when it uses sensations to help control objects as opposed to just perceiving them . This could influence the development of new technology that aims to use brain activity to control computers or robotic limbs ."," In this study, researchers wanted to know how well people can sense the direction that an object's edge is pointing when they touch it while moving their hand across its surface. They found that people could do this extremely fast (in just 150 milliseconds) and very accurately (better than 97%). This means that humans have much more sensitive finger sensors than previously thought! These findings will help us understand how we use touch to feel the shape of things around us. For example, if you want to pick up a pen from your desk without looking at it, knowing how well we can sense different shapes might help you move your fingers faster and more smoothly so that you don't drop the pen. It would be like having ""super senses"" on your hands! By learning more about what our bodies can feel, maybe we can make tools or robots that work almost as well as human hands. That way, instead of always needing someone else to hold our stuff for us, we could rely on machines that have super senses! And who knows? Maybe one day we'll all get to wear special gloves that give us extra powers too! Wouldn't that be awesome?! 🦸‍♂️🤖💥"
"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( or ALS ) is a disease that affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord , such that more and more of these cells die as the disease progresses . Since nerve cells direct muscle movement , people with ALS increasingly lose control of their muscles , and may therefore lose the ability to speak , eat , move , and breathe . Around one in five people who have an inherited form of ALS also have mutations in a gene that encodes an enzyme called SOD1 . This antioxidant enzyme detoxifies harmful chemicals that are the byproducts of normal cellular activity . The mature active form of this enzyme contains two SOD1 proteins , each of which binds one copper ion and one zinc ion . Each protein in a pair also contains a strong bond that helps to stabilize its three-dimensional structure . However , immature copies of this protein , which lack the strong bond and metal ions , often fold into the wrong shape . These misfolded proteins can clump together into clusters , and potentially lead to the development of ALS . Efforts to study misfolded proteins are limited by the fact that misfolding is a rare event . As a result , protein samples generally contain very small fractions of misfolded molecules and most techniques for investigating protein structure are ill-suited to probe the process of misfolding . Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( or NMR for short ) is one technique that has been used to visualize flexible proteins , and protein folding and misfolding , down to the level of individual atoms . Recent improvements in NMR spectroscopy have opened up the possibility of studying protein structures that exist at levels as low as 1% of the sample . Now , Sekhar et al . have used NMR to document the dynamics of immature SOD1 proteins . The experiments show that the protein is flexible and readily switches back and forth between its ‘default’ shape and one of at least four different shapes; and at any one time , the fraction of molecules in solution that were in each of these shapes was around 1% . Two of the shapes have many of the same features as those in a mature SOD1 protein pair . But the other two shapes involve SOD1 proteins interacting in unusual ways , and may resemble the cluster-forming misfolded SOD1 proteins . By using the NMR data to create three-dimensional models of the SOD1 proteins , Sekhar et al . were able to identify two sites on immature SOD1 proteins involved in these unusual interactions that are inaccessible in mature enzymatically active SOD1 . These findings suggest that targeting these two sites with drugs could possibly block the formation of toxic versions of SOD1 early in the course of ALS , and thus prevent the progression of the disease ."," Amyotrophy Lateral Sclerotic Diseases (ALS) are caused by different forms of proteins called SOD 1. These proteins can take on many shapes, some of them being toxic to cells. Scientists have studied how these proteins change shape using special techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). They found that there were actually several different shapes that the proteins could take on at once. Some of these shapes had characteristics similar to those of normal SOD proteins while others did not. This suggests that there may be multiple ways in which SOD can become toxic. Understanding this process better might help scientists find new treatments for ALS. Key words: amyotrohophic later scleroses, SOD, mutated, structure, function, aggregation, oligmerization. Lay Summary: Amyotropic Lateral sclerosis (ALs) is a disease caused by changes in a type of protein called Sodl. Sometimes these changes cause the proteint to form clumps that harm cells. Researchers used special tools to study how these changes happen. They found out that sometimes the proteinstake on different shapes as it changed. Someof these shapes looked like normal proteins but others didnot. This means that there are different ways that the protein can change and become harmful."
"A hormone called insulin finely controls the amount of sugar in the blood . When the blood sugar content is high , a group of cells in the pancreas release insulin; when it is low , they stop . In these cells , the level of sugar in the blood modifies the ratio of two molecules: ATP , the body’s energy currency , and ADP , a molecule closely related to ATP . Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio are therefore a proxy of the variations in blood sugar levels . In these pancreatic cells , a membrane protein called ATP sensitive potassium channel , KATP channel for short , acts as a switch that turns on and off the production of insulin . ATP and ADP control that switch , with the two molecules having opposite effects on the channel – ATP deactivates it , ADP activates it . The changes in ATP/ADP ratio – and by extension in blood sugar levels – are therefore coupled with the release of insulin . However , how KATP channels sense the changes in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells is still unclear . In particular , ATP levels are usually high and constant: ATP is then continuously deactivating the channels , and it is unclear how ADP ever activates them . Here , Lee et al . use a microscopy technique that can image biological molecules at the atomic scale to look at the structure of human pancreatic KATP channels . The 3D reconstruction maps show that KATP channels have binding sites for ATP but also one for ADP . This ADP site acts as a sensor that can detect even small changes in ADP levels in the cell . The maps also reveal a dynamic lasso-like structure connecting the ATP and ADP binding areas . This domain may play a vital role in allowing ADP to override ATP’s control of the channel . The presence of the ADP sensor and the lasso structure could explain how KATP channels monitor changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and can therefore control the release of insulin based on blood sugar levels . Defects in the KATP channels of the pancreas are present in genetic diseases where infants produce too much or too little insulin . Understanding the structure of these channels and how they work may help scientists to design new drugs to treat these conditions ."," Scientists have discovered how different levels of adenine triphosphate (ATP) affect the function of a protein called KATPs. They used special technology that allowed them to take pictures of these proteins very close up when they are attached to other molecules. This helped them see what happens to the proteins when there is more or less ATP around. When there is low amounts of ATP, this protein does not work well. However, if you add another type of molecule called adenyl diphosphate (ADP), it starts working again. It turns out that this protein has something inside it that acts like a switch. If there is enough ATP in the cell, then the switch stays one way. But if there isn't enough ATC, then another part of the protein can turn on the switch so things start working normally again. This new discovery helps us understand why some parts of our bodies need certain kinds of chemicals to be able to move properly. For example, your heart needs to keep beating all day long without stopping. To do this, it uses energy from chemicals like ATP. Sometimes, though, we eat foods that don't give our hearts enough energy. That's why sometimes people who exercise a lot drink things like coffee which gives their body extra energy."
"Over a billion people worldwide are infected , often for life , by a parasite known as Toxoplasma gondii . Most of the time , the parasites remain in a dormant state and cause no symptoms . However , the parasites can reactivate , which can be fatal for people with weaker immune systems . Currently no drugs can kill the dormant stages of T . gondii . One of the possible reasons T . gondii is so widespread is because it easily passes from host to host , and resists both detection and treatment . Like many parasites , T . gondii infects multiple hosts during its life cycle: it reproduces sexually in its ‘definitive' host , the cat , and reproduces asexually in its ‘intermediate’ hosts , which include virtually all warm-blooded animals . Unlike most parasites , all hosts can transmit T . gondii to other hosts , making it a very flexible parasite . However , its closest living relative , Hammondia hammondi , can only be transmitted from a definitive host to an intermediate host , or vice versa . The reason for this difference remains unclear , but comparisons between these species can hopefully help uncover how T . gondii came to be such a promiscuous parasite . Now , Sokol , Primack et al . report that a dramatic difference between H . hammondi and T . gondii is the ability to adapt to changes in the environment . While H . hammondi grows in a very strict and inflexible way , T . gondii can sense its environment and change its growth rate accordingly . This is important because it would allow T . gondii to grow until the host immune response is activated , at which time T . gondii can then quickly become dormant and hide from these host defences . Sokol , Primack et al . suggest that this unique adaptation may have helped T . gondii to become the globally successful parasite that it is today , and explain why H . hammondi is much less lethal . It is also possible that T . gondii reactivates after periods of dormancy because it senses changes in its environment . If so , and if scientists can identify the sensors required for this , it may also be possible to target them and effectively block reactivation in infected humans . Comparing T . gondii with H . hammondi may provide a good way to identify these sensors ."," Scientists wanted to learn more about how two related types of parasites called Toxoplasmagondii (Tg) andHammondiahammondii(Hh) develop. They know that both can infect animals like rodents or cats, but only Tg can live inside animal cells while Hh has to stay outside of them. This makes Tg a ""facultative"" heteroxeneous parasite, which means it can live in one host and then switch to another if needed. On the other hand, Hh needs to jump from host to host all the time because it's an ""obligate"" heterxeneous organism. So, scientists studied how each type grows and responds to things like heat or chemicals. They found that there are several different ways that Hh can grow, some of which don't happen in Tg at all. For example, when exposed to certain chemicals, Hhspecies just keep growing normally, unlike Tgspecies, which stop growing and start turning into special kinds of cells instead. By learning more about these differences, researchers hope they will find out why Tgcan change hosts so easily, while Hhcannot. Maybe understanding what makes them different will help us come up with new ways to fight both parasites!"
"Inside the nucleus of a cell , the DNA is wound around histone proteins . This forms a structure called chromatin that allows the long DNA strands to fit inside the cell . Variations in chromatin structure also help the cell to control the functional properties of DNA . For example , a large proportion of chromatin in the cell is in the form of heterochromatin , which is very densely packed , and is associated with many roles such as gene silencing and keeping DNA intact during reproduction . Many animals and plants have two copies of each DNA molecule: one inherited from the mother , and one from the father of the organism . Reproductive cells undergo a process called recombination when they form , where the matching copies of each DNA molecule break in a number of places and rejoin to form a new ‘blend’ of their mother's and their father's DNA , which is passed on to their own offspring . In contrast , most heterochromatin is inherited without recombining , preserving it in an unaltered form . This is important since recombination in heterochromatin can create genetic abnormalities . Adding small chemical modifications—such as methyl groups—to the histone proteins at the core of the chromatin can change how the DNA is packed . However , the histone modifications that yield different chromatin structures , and the effect of these modifications , are not very well understood . Papazyan et al . have taken advantage of a distinct feature of the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila: a single-celled organism that divides its chromatin into two different nuclei . The smaller micronuclei contain only heterochromatin , and Papazyan et al . discovered that the histone H3 protein in the micronuclei is modified by methyl groups at a specific site that had not been studied before . Furthermore , this protozoan makes more of these modifications when it reproduces . An enzyme called Ezl3p adds these methyl groups , and without this enzyme T . thermophila reproduces more slowly and has offspring that are less likely to survive and more likely to be infertile . Papazyan et al . provide evidence that these characteristics arise because the cells without the histone modification are unable to prevent DNA breaks from occurring in heterochromatin during recombination . The same histone modification also occurs when the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans reproduces , suggesting that this method of DNA protection has been conserved throughout evolution . Papazyan et al . propose that the histone modification may prevent another enzyme that induces DNA breaks from accessing the heterochromatin in reproductive cells; but more work is required to support this hypothesis . These findings reveal the importance of a new histone modification during reproduction , and could provide new directions for infertility research ."," Scientists have found a new type of chemical mark on certain proteins called ""H3K9me3"" that helps keep important parts of the genome safe. They think it might work like a lock on a vault door. To test their idea, they used tiny worms as models because they can easily change some of the chemicals on these proteins. By changing one kind of chemical marker, the scientists were able to make the worms lose the protection provided by the ""lock"". This showed them that the ""chemical lock"" really does help keep the genomic material safe. It also helped them understand how the process works better. Overall, this study shows us that there are different ways to add or remove chemical marks on proteins, which can be helpful when trying to find out more about diseases. For example, if someone has too much of one kind or not enough of another kind of ""lock"", then they could get sick. Understanding how these locks work will help doctors figure out what causes people to get sick so they can come up with treatments. In addition, knowing how to turn off or turn on these locks could help treat genetic disorders. This would allow researchers to fix problems at the source instead of just treating symptoms. However, before any of those things happen, scientists need to learn even more about how these special kinds of protein locks work."
"Monoculture , where only one type of crop is grown to the exclusion of any other organism , is a pillar of modern agriculture . Yet this narrow focus disregards how complex inter-species interactions can increase crop yield and biodiversity while decreasing the need for fertilizers or pesticides . For example , many farmers across Asia introduce carps , crabs , turtles or other freshwater grazers into their rice paddies . This coculture approach yields promising results but remains poorly understood . In particular , it is unclear how these animals’ behaviours and biological processes benefit the ecosystem . To examine these questions , Guo , Zhao et al . conducted three separate four-year field experiments; they compared rice plots inhabited by either carp , mitten crabs or Chinese softshell turtles with fields where these organisms were not present . With animals , the rice paddies had less weeds , better crop yields and steady levels of nitrogen ( a natural fertiliser ) in their soil . These ecosystems could breakdown organic matter faster , use it better and had a reduced need for added fertilizer . While animal feed was provided in the areas that were studied , carp , crabs and turtles obtained up to half their food from the field itself , eating weeds , algae and pests and therefore reducing competition for the crops . This work helps to understand the importance of species interactions , showing that diversifying monocultures may boost yields and make agriculture more sustainable ."," Rice farming often involves growing only one type of plant at a time, which can lead to problems such as low crop yields or poor nutrient management. However, if certain types of fish, crustaceans, and amphibians are raised along with the crops, this could help solve some of those problems. To test this idea, researchers compared two ways of raising rice plants: either alone or together with various kinds of aquaculture animals. They found that having aquacultural animals around increased both crop and aquaculturual yields, improved the way the land was used, and helped keep the soil healthy. These findings support the idea that combining different types of plants and animals can improve agricultural practices. This approach might be especially useful in areas where there is limited space available for agriculture. Further studies should explore other possible benefits of using this method. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into how we can better manage our agricultural lands in a sustainable manner. By incorporating aquaculural animals into rice farms, we can potentially produce more food with fewer resources while protecting the environment. It would be interesting to see whether similar approaches could work in other parts of the world too. For example, it would be worth exploring whether keeping livestock near gardens or fruit trees could help improve the health of the soil and reduce pests."
"Humans and other animals need a variety of fat molecules known as lipids to survive and grow . For example , members of a large family of lipids called sphingolipids play crucial roles in many cell processes and are essential for tissues and organs to form as animal embryos develop . A molecule called sphingosine is the basic building block of most sphingolipids . An enzyme known as sphingosine kinase 2 ( Sphk2 ) converts sphingosine into a sphingolipid called sphingosine 1-phosphate , which is released from cells and regulates communication between cells . Another enzyme called ceramide synthase 2b ( Cers2b ) converts sphingosine into ceramide , which is required for the membrane surrounding individual cells to work properly . Excess levels of particular sphingolipids can be toxic to cells so animals carefully control the levels of these molecules in their bodies . However , it was not clear how animal cells sense the molecules and regulate their production and breakdown . Mendelson et al . addressed this question by studying mutant zebrafish embryos that fail to produce Sphk2 and thus produce little or no sphingosine 1-phosphate . It was thought that the mutant zebrafish may experience the toxic effects of high levels of sphingosine because they are unable to convert it to sphingosine 1-phosphate . However , the experiments show that the mutant embryos are able to avoid this toxicity by increasing the production of the Cers2b enzyme . Somehow the gene that encodes this enzyme is able to sense high levels of sphingosine and responds by increasing its own production , which in turn increases the conversion of sphingosine into the non-toxic ceramide . Further experiments found that this mechanism for sensing and removing excess sphingosine is already operating at an earlier stage of development when the zebrafish is just an egg . Further work is needed to understand exactly how this sphingosine sensing mechanism works . These findings may help us to develop new treatments for diseases caused by an imbalance in sphingolipids , such as diabetes and cancer . This work may also help to increase the success of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and other fertility therapies by enhancing the survival of human egg cells ."," Scientists found that when there was not enough sphinganine turned into sphingasine, it caused problems in fish embryo growth. They discovered that certain genes were activated to help fix this problem. These genes make a type of fat called ceramides. When these genes did not work properly, the fish embries had even more problems growing. This shows how important it is for the body to be able to make different types of fats when one kind isn't working right. It would be helpful if scientists could find ways to use these findings to help people whose bodies cannot make certain kinds of fads normally. For example, some babies born with brain defects do not make enough sphinogosine. If doctors knew which genes to activate or turn off, they might be able prevent other health issues from happening later on. Or maybe they could figure out how to give babies who don’t produce enough sphinosine what they need so their brains will develop better. That would be really cool! Science is awesome!

"Cognitive neuroscience studies the links between the physical brain and cognition . Computational models that attempt to describe the relationships between the brain and specific behaviours quantitatively is becoming increasingly popular in this field . This approach may help determine the causes of certain behaviours and make predictions about what behaviours will be triggered by specific changes in the brain . Many of the computational models used in cognitive neuroscience are built based on experimental data . A good model can predict the results of new experiments given a specific set of conditions with few parameters . Candidate models are often called ‘generative’: models that can simulate data . However , typically , cognitive neuroscience studies require going the other way around: they need to infer models and their parameters from experimental data . Ideally , it should also be possible to properly assess the remaining uncertainty over the parameters after having access to the experimental data . To facilitate this , the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has become popular in cognitive neuroscience . Common software tools for Bayesian estimation require a ‘likelihood function’ , which measures how well a model fits experimental data for given values of the unknown parameters . A major obstacle is that for all but the most common models , obtaining precise likelihood functions is computationally costly . In practice , this requirement limits researchers to evaluating and comparing a small subset of neurocognitive models for which a likelihood function is known . As a result , it is convenience , rather than theoretical interest , that guides this process . In order to provide one solution for this problem , Fengler et al . developed a method that allows users to perform Bayesian inference on a larger number of models without high simulation costs . This method uses likelihood approximation networks ( LANs ) , a computational tool that can estimate likelihood functions for a broad class of models of decision making , allowing researchers to estimate parameters and to measure how well models fit the data . Additionally , Fengler et al . provide both the code needed to build networks using their approach and a tutorial for users . The new method , along with the user-friendly tool , may help to discover more realistic brain dynamics underlying cognition and behaviour as well as alterations in brain function ."," In science, sometimes scientists use computer programs called ""models"" to help them understand how things work. These models have lots of different pieces and parts, like people and processes in real life. Sometimes it's hard to figure out which model best explains what you want to know about. To do this, scientists need to compare all the possible models they came up with and see which one fits the best. This is called ""model fitting."" But not all models come with an easy way to fit them! So, researchers developed new ways to make models that are easier to fit, even if those models aren't as accurate as some others. They did this using something called ""neural networks,"" which are kind of like brains because they take in information from one place and then spit out answers on the other side. Now, scientists can quickly find the right model to explain what they want to understand better than ever before! And now anyone can try it too, since we made the code available online so you can play around with it yourself! Just go to https://github.com/jordan-g/likelihood_approximation_networks. If you don’t know what any of that means, just remember that scientists figured out a new way to pick the perfect model faster than ever, and now you can try doing it too!"
"A cell about to divide must decide where exactly to cut itself in two . Split right down the middle , and the two daughter cells will be identical; offset the cleavage plane to one side , and the resulting siblings will have different sizes , places and fates . In animals , the splitting of cells is dictated by the location of the spindle , a structure that forms when cable-like microtubules stretch from the cell membrane to attach to the chromosomes . At the membrane , a group of proteins tugs on the microtubules to bring the spindle into the correct position . One of these proteins , dynein , is a motor that uses microtubules as its track to pull the spindle into place . What the other parts of the complex do is still unclear , but a general assumption is that they may be serving as an anchor for dynein . To test this model , Fielmich , Schmidt et al . removed one or more proteins from the complex in the developing embryos of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans . A light-activated system then linked the remaining proteins to the membrane by tying them to an artificial anchor . Two of the proteins in the complex could be replaced with the artificial anchor , but pulling forces were absent when dynein was artificially tied to the membrane . This indicates that the motor being anchored at the edge of the cell is not enough for it to pull on microtubules . Instead , the experiments showed that dynein needs to be activated by another component of the complex , a protein called LIN-5 . This suggests that individual proteins in the complex have specialized roles that go beyond simply tethering dynein . In fact , steering where LIN-5 was attached on the membrane helped to control the location of the spindle , and therefore of the cleavage plane . As mammals have a protein similar to LIN-5 , dissecting the roles of the components involved in positioning the spindle in C . elegans could help to understand normal and abnormal human development . In addition , these results demonstrate that creating artificial interactions between proteins using light is a powerful technique to study biological processes ."," This study used worms (Caenorhabditis elegans) to investigate how cells divide during development. During division, the two newborn cells need to be positioned correctly relative to each other. How this happens has been studied extensively using different model organisms such as yeast, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, mouse, and human cells. However, it was still unclear what role specific molecules play in this process. These molecules include G protein alpha subunit (Gα), guanosine diphosphate (GDP), guanyl nucleotide binding protein 1 receptor 1 and 2 (GPR1/GPR2), Par3/Par6/aPKC complex, Mud/NUMA, and RhoA. Using worms, researchers were able to manipulate these molecules and observe their effects on cell division. They found that when they removed Gα or GPR1 and GAPR2 from the system, the worms could still divide normally even though some errors occurred occasionally. When they removed MUD/NUM, however, the cells failed to divide properly. Their findings suggest that MUD plays a critical role in dividing cells while Gα does not seem to have any essential function."
"Animals store the main part of their DNA—including all of the genes that are required to build and maintain an individual—inside their cells in a structure called the nucleus . Most of the information stored in the DNA is stored in duplicate , with one copy inherited from the individual's mother via the egg , and the other from the father via the sperm . This duplicate storage allows a very important damage repair process to occur , where undamaged sequences in one copy can be used to repair damage in the other . This process of homologous repair uses mechanisms that are also used in another important genetic process . When sperm and egg cells are formed , the parental DNA goes through a process called homologous recombination , in which DNA molecules are cut and reassembled into new arrangements . This recombination process ‘shuffles’ genetic combinations , making every individual unique—a process of great evolutionary importance that allows natural selection to act on distinct traits . The structures inside cells that generate energy—called mitochondria—also contain DNA , which is inherited only from mothers . Little is known about whether recombination is possible in the mitochondrial DNA of animals . Ma and O'Farrell used genetics techniques to investigate recombination in the mitochondria of fruit flies . One experiment tracked how a mutation that makes flies less healthy at high temperatures spread as flies were bred for several generations . When the mutation was associated with a mitochondrial genome that had a strong drive towards replication , the mutation became more widespread over time , and in most cases , this eventually resulted in the mutation killing the flies . In rare cases , however , a few flies survived , giving rise to a healthy population . Molecular analyses revealed that , in these survivors , the defective genome had recombined with the other mitochondrial DNA to produce a new genome that lacked the mutation but retained the high replicative drive . This new recombinant genome worked normally and was able to resist the spread of the defective genomes . In addition , by artificially cutting mitochondrial DNA , Ma and O'Farrell show that such ‘double-strand breaks’ lead to recombination , signaling a role for homologous repair in the repair of damaged , in this case broken , DNA . Recombination is also possible between the mitochondrial DNA of two different fruit fly species , and this recombination process can assemble long stretches of DNA . Now that the recombination of animal mitochondrial DNA is known to be possible , future work will be required to understand how it works and how it affects evolution ."," Scientists have found evidence that shows how certain types of genetic changes happen in the mitochndria (mtDNA) of some kinds of flies called Drosphila. These genetic changes involve swapping pieces of DNA between two copies of mtDna that exist at the same time inside one cell. This process is called ""recombination"". To study this phenomenon further, scientists created special conditions where these flies could undergo recombining more often than they normally would. They then looked at what happened when these flies passed on their genes to their offspring. Under these special conditions, the scientists saw that some offspring had new combinations of mtDNAs that were different from either of the original ones. This means that recombinations did indeed happen in these flies' cells. Furthermore, when the scientists examined these new combinations closely, they discovered that large sections of the DNA had been exchanged all at once, rather than just small bits of it. Finally, by looking carefully at which versions of the gene ended up in each fly, the researchers were able to figure out which parts of the mtDNa were most likely responsible for a specific feature of the fly. Overall, this work suggests that recombing might be useful for learning more about how different features of an organism are related to different versions of its mtDnA."
"Our immune system constantly patrols our body , looking to eliminate cancerous cells and harmful microbes . It can spot these threats because it recognizes certain signals at the surface of dangerous cells . However , cancer cells often find ways to ‘hide’ from our immune system . Chimeric antigen receptors , or CARs , are receptors designed in a laboratory to attach to specific proteins that are found on a cancer cell . These receptors tell immune cells , such as T cells , to attack cancers . T cells that carry CARs are already used to treat people with blood cancers . Yet , these immune cells are not good at penetrating a solid tumor to kill the cells inside , which limits their use . Macrophages are a group of immune cells that can make their way inside tumors and travel to cancers that the rest of the immune system cannot reach . They defend our body by ‘swallowing’ harmful cells . Would it then be possible to use CARs to program macrophages to ‘eat’ cancer cells ? Morrissey , Williamson et al . created a new type of CARs , named CAR-P , and introduced it in macrophages . These cells were then able to recognize and attack beads covered in proteins found on cancer cells . The modified macrophages could also limit the growth of live cancer cells in a dish by ‘biting’ and even ‘eating’ them . While these results are promising in the laboratory , the next step is to test whether these reprogrammed macrophages can recognize and fight cancers in living animals ."," Scientists have developed new tools called chimeric anti-receptors, or “CARS,” that allow them to control how certain types of cells behave. These CARS work by changing how proteins inside cells respond when they come into contact with something outside of the cell. Specifically, these CAR tools change how proteons inside cells react when those cells encounter things like cancer cells. This allows scientists to use the CAR tool to help fight against cancer cells by having the cells do different things than normal. In this study, researchers made even more advanced versions of these CAT tools, called CARPs, that could make macrophage cells eat things like tumor cells. They did this by adding parts of proteins onto the CART tools that would cause the macrophags to eat things. Then they tested whether these CAPR tools worked as expected. They also added another part of protein on top of the CAPRT tools to try to increase how well the macrohogs ate things. Finally, they showed that if they put the CAPP tools into mouse macrophag cells, then those cells were able to eat cancer cells better than without the CATT tools. Overall, this shows that it might be possible to develop new ways to treat cancer using special tools that tell our bodies’ own cells what to do."
"To allow a complex animal to develop from a small bundle of cells , the cells need to be able to communicate with each other to coordinate their activities . Furthermore , this communication needs to continue in adulthood to keep the body in balance and to prevent diseases such as cancer . The cells communicate by releasing signals that influence the behavior of their neighbors by activating proteins called transcription factors . These proteins then change the activity of particular genes in the nucleus by binding to specific places on a structure called chromatin ( the structure in which the genes are packaged ) . One group of signaling molecules is known as the transforming growth factor beta superfamily , which is crucial for embryos to develop correctly . Failure to control these signals can also promote the growth of tumors . However , it is not clear how the detection of these signals at the surface of the cell leads to changes in the activity of genes inside the nucleus . Two transforming growth factor beta signals called Activin and NODAL cause a transcription factor known as SMAD2 to move into the nucleus where it can alter gene activity . Here Coda , Gaarenstroom et al . investigated how SMAD2 transmits the Activin/Nodal signal in mouse cancer cells . The experiments showed that SMAD2 can change the activities of genes in multiple ways . SMAD2 can bind to places in the chromatin that are either easy to access ( which typically contain genes that are already “switched on” ) as well as areas that are difficult to access ( which generally contain genes that are “switched off” ) . As a result , SMAD2 increases the activity of genes that were already active , but also switches on on genes that were previously inactive . Coda , Gaarenstroom et al . also found evidence that SMAD2 remained bound to chromatin after long periods of Activin/NODAL signaling . For some genes , this resulted in high gene activity , but in other cases this decreased the gene’s activity . Therefore , future experiments will investigate which other proteins help SMAD2 to change gene activity at later times ."," In this study, researchers wanted to understand how cells respond to different types of signals called ""NODA"" and ""ACTIVIN"". These signals activate molecules inside the cell called ""SMADS"", which then go into the DNA to turn on certain genes. Researchers already knew that these SMAD proteins could change the way DNA wraps around histones (called ""chromatin""), but they didn't know exactly how. They found out that there were actually TWO ways that SMADD proteins interact with DNA. One way was that SMARD proteins would only attach to parts of the DNA that had been loosened up so that other proteins called ""pioneer factors"" could get through. Once those pioneer proteins got through, SMARD protein would follow close behind. This first type of interaction happened quickly after the signal came through. But sometimes, SMADD proteins attached themselves to areas of DNA that were tightly packed together (""closed chromatin""). To make room for more proteins to fit, SMADD caused some of the histones to be removed completely, allowing access for other proteINS like ""transcription factors"" to come in and start making RNA copies of the gene. This second type of attachment took longer because it required more work to open up the area of DNA beforehand."
"In the nucleus of a cell , the DNA that contains the cell's genetic information is packaged into long structures called chromosomes . Every time a cell divides , its chromosomes are duplicated . However , the proteins that are responsible for copying the DNA cannot reach the very end of the DNA strand , causing the chromosomes to progressively shorten . To ensure that this does not cause genetic information to be lost , each chromosome ends in a repetitive stretch of DNA called a telomere . Though the end of the telomere is lost whenever the DNA is copied , an enzyme called telomerase replaces the sequence that has been lost and counteracts the shortening of the telomeres . Shelterin is a protein complex that binds to telomeres to protect them and also helps telomerase to work correctly . Shelterin contains a specific site that attaches to telomerase , but exactly how the human versions of these two molecules bind to each other is unknown . A possible interaction site had been identified on the telomerase , which , when mutated , stops the telomerase working properly . However , as this region is also involved in lengthening the telomeres after the chromosomes have duplicated , it is not certain that these problems result from the telomerase failing to bind to shelterin . The enzyme telomerase is unusual; it has both RNA and protein components . Like all other proteins , the telomerase protein is made up of strings of amino acids . Schmidt et al . discovered that replacing two specific amino acids in human telomerase prevents its binding to shelterin . Cells that produced the modified form of the telomerase had chromosomes with shortened telomeres . However , if the cells also produced modified versions of the shelterin complex that were designed to bind to the modified telomerase , telomere length was normal . This indicates that the telomerase interacts directly with shelterin , rather than through a ‘bridging’ molecule . Mutations in the genes coding for both shelterin and the telomerase enzyme cause a number of human diseases , and cancers rely on the activity of telomerases to grow . Knowing how shelterin and telomerase interact could therefore help to design drugs that may either restore or disrupt the interaction and therefore can be used to treat these diseases ."," Scientists discovered a part of a protein called the “OB fold” that helps another protein called “telomerase” attach to the end of our genes, which is called a “telo”. This attachment is important because it keeps our tels from breaking apart or being damaged. They found out how exactly these two proteins work together using special techniques like genetic engineering. Now scientists know more about how telomerases attach to tels, which could help them find ways to treat diseases caused by broken tels. For example, some cancers happen when tels break apart and keep shortening. So now scientists might be able to make new drugs that stop cancer cells from growing. That’s pretty cool!

"Tuberculosis is an important public health threat around the globe and is particularly common in developing countries . It is difficult to control the spread of the disease because the bacteria that cause it can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . It may take years for an infected individual to develop symptoms of tuberculosis so it can be hard to trace the source of an outbreak , and people infected with HIV are particularly susceptible to the disease . The bacterium that causes the majority of cases of tuberculosis is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . There are several different varieties or ‘lineages’ of M . tuberculosis , and it is thought that they may vary in their ability to spread and cause disease . However , the results of previous studies have been inconsistent and there also seems to be a lot of variation between strains within the same lineage . In this study , Guerra-Assunção et al . used an approach called whole genome sequencing alongside more traditional methods to study the spread of tuberculosis in Malawi . They sequenced the genomes of every available sample of M . tuberculosis collected from patients in the Karonga district of Malawi over a 15-year period . This produced high-quality DNA sequence data about the bacteria responsible for almost 1700 cases of disease . Using this massive amount of data , Guerra-Assunção et al . constructed networks that showed how the bacteria had spread in the community . This revealed that there were differences between the ability of the various M . tuberculosis lineages to cause disease and to spread in communities . For example , lineage 1 was less likely than the other lineages to cause disease soon after infecting an individual and was less able to spread . The data also show that the proportion of cases of disease due to recent infection declined substantially during the 15-year period . This indicates that the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes in the area have been successful . Guerra-Assunção et al . 's findings show that it is possible to understand how tuberculosis is transmitted on a large scale . The next challenge is to understand why the lineages differ in their ability to cause disease and spread between individuals ."," In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about how different types of Mycocbacterium Tuberculosis spreads in an area where there is a lot of TB cases. To do so, they used special techniques to sequence the DNA of bacteria found in people who had been recently infected with TB. They then compared the genetic make up of these bacteria to see which ones were similar enough to be considered related. By doing this, they could map out how certain strains of Tuberculate may have spread through the community. This allowed them to estimate how many new cases might have resulted from just one person being infected. They also looked at how likely it was for someone to pass on TB based on what type of strain they had. Finally, they saw whether the number of new cases caused by each strain changed over time. Overall, their results suggest that some strains are much better at spreading than others, and that the likelihood of getting sick from those strains has gone down over time despite the overall number of Tubercule cases remaining high. These findings can help doctors and public health officials develop strategies to target specific strains and reduce the risk of Tubeclature outbreaks in the future. It's important to note that while this study focused specifically on Malawian communities, its methods and findings may have broader implications for understanding and controlling the spread of TUBERCULOSIS worldwide."
"Proteins are long chain-like molecules that twist and fold into complex three-dimensional shapes in order to carry out their functions . High temperatures or other types of stress can cause proteins to fold incorrectly , and misfolded proteins can form clumps ( or aggregates ) that are harmful to cells . Additional proteins called chaperones are therefore used by cells to help proteins to fold correctly , or to refold poorly folded proteins . ClpB proteins ( and related proteins ) are chaperones found in bacteria , fungi and plants; these proteins co-operate with other chaperones to rescue misfolded proteins that have aggregated—an activity that helps cells to survive heat shock and other stresses . Six ClpB proteins work together to form a ring-shaped complex , and the misfolded protein is unfolded by threading it through the centre of this ring . Each ClpB protein also has a middle domain that acts to switch the complex on and off as needed . The middle domains are known to form coiled-coils , with protein helices coiled together like the strands of a rope . However , previous efforts to work out the structure of the ClpB complex did not clearly establish where these coiled-coils were positioned relative to the rest of the ring . Now Carroni et al . have used image processing to overcome these problems and reveal that the middle domains are wrapped around the outer edge of the ring complex . Analysis of ClpB mutants that lock the complex in either an off or on state revealed that the middle domains are linked head-to tail to encircle the ring when the complex is off . However , when the complex switches on , the middle domains let go of each other and tilt , allowing the ring to change shape . Carroni et al . suggest that the exposed ends of the middle domains are free to bind to other chaperones ( those that work to refold the unfolded proteins ) , thereby activating the complex . Although Carroni et al . have revealed how the ClpB ring complex is activated , further work is needed to understand exactly how the unlocked ring works to rescue misfolded proteins from aggregates within cells ."," Scientists have studied how a special machine called Clp B works when it helps unfold tangled up proteins so they can be used again. They found out that different parts of the machine work together like a team to help each other do their jobs better. When one part does not know what to do or where to go, the whole team cannot work well. By understanding more about how these machines work, scientists may be able to make them work even better and fix broken proteins faster. This could help doctors find cures for diseases caused by broken proteINS. 1) What was done? Researchers analyzed the structure of a protein complex using advanced imaging techniques. 2) What did the researchers find? The researchers discovered that different regions within the same protein interact with each other to allow the protein to function properly. 3) Why is this important? Understanding how proteins work together will help us learn how to treat diseases caused from problems with proteins. It also gives us new ways to study how proteasomes work. 4) What do the authors want to happen now? The authors hope that their findings inspire others to continue studying how proteases work and how we might use them to cure disease. 5) How will the results change things? These findings give us new insights into how proteolytic systems work and provide clues as to how we can control them."
"Magnesium is an essential element for living cells , meaning that organisms from bacteria to humans need magnesium to survive . All cells are surrounded by a membrane made of fatty molecules called lipids , which is also embedded with proteins . Magnesium , like other metal ions , is transported inside cells across the cell’s membrane by specific membrane proteins . A species of gut bacteria called E . coli has two separate magnesium transport systems: one that works at high concentrations of magnesium and one at lower concentrations . The latter system involves a membrane protein called magnesium transporter A ( or MgtA for short ) , which works like a molecular pump . However , it was not known exactly how this transporter was affected by magnesium nor how sensitive it was to this divalent metal ion . It was also unclear whether MgtA worked alone in the bacterial membrane or if it worked in conjunction with other molecules . Now Subramani et al . have managed to show that MgtA can sense magnesium ions down to micromolar concentrations , which is the equivalent to a pinch ( 1 gram ) of magnesium salt in 10 , 000 liters of water . The experiments also showed that this detection system depended on a specific lipid molecule in the membrane called cardiolipin . MgtA and cardiolipin were found together in the membrane of living E . coli suggesting that the two do indeed work together . The discovery that a membrane transporter that pumps ions needs cardiolipin to work suggests that cells could indirectly control the movement of ions by changing the levels of specific lipids in their membranes . Subramani et al . now hope to use techniques , such as X-ray crystallography , to visualize how magnesium and cardiolipin bind to MtgA and explore how the three molecules work together as a complete system . Information about these interactions could in the future help researchers understand how these bacteria try to protect themself in the hostile environment in the human gut or cells of the immune systems . Further studies of this system could be used to develop biological sensors for magnesium or to design antibiotics that interfere with the magnesium transporter to treat bacterial infections ."," Scientists have discovered a protein called MgtE that helps bacteria take up magneses from outside their cells. They wanted to learn more about how this protein works. To do so, they studied it using different methods such as looking at where it was located inside the cell and what affected its activity. They found out that MGTa needs special kinds of fatty acids found in bacterial cells to work properly. These fatty acid molecules also help the protein sense changes in the amount of magnesese around it. Based on these results, scientists believe that MGTA might be able to detect when there's too little or too much magnesesa outside the cell, and then decide whether to bring some in or keep it out. Overall, this study has helped us understand better how bacteria can use proteins like MgtEA to make sure they get just the right amount of nutrients they need to survive. By learning more about these processes, we could potentially find ways to control them and even develop new treatments for diseases caused by bacteria. For example, if we know exactly how certain proteins work, we might be better able to target them specifically without affecting other important parts of the body. That would make treating patients with antibiotics or other medicines safer and more effective."
"Since the first outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976 , there have been numerous other outbreaks in humans across Africa with fatality rates ranging from 50% to 90% . Humans can become infected with the Ebola virus after direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal . The virus also infects and kills other primates—such as chimpanzees or gorillas—though Old World fruit bats are suspected to be the most likely carriers of the virus in the wild . The largest recorded outbreak of Ebola virus disease is ongoing in West Africa: more people have been infected in this current outbreak than in all previous outbreaks combined . The current outbreak is also the first to occur in West Africa—which is outside the previously known range of the Ebola virus . Pigott et al . have now updated predictions about where in Africa wild animals may harbour the virus and where the transmission of the virus from these animals to humans is possible . As such , the map identifies the regions that are most at risk of a future Ebola outbreak . The data behind these new maps include the locations of all recorded primary cases of Ebola in human populations—the ‘index’ cases—many of which have been linked to animal sources . The data also include the locations of recorded cases of Ebola virus infections in wild bats and primates from the last forty years . The maps , which were modelled using more flexible methods than previous predictions , also include new information—collected using satellites—about environmental factors and new predictions of the range of wild fruit bats . Pigott et al . report that the transmission of Ebola virus from animals to humans is possible in 22 countries across Central and West Africa—and that 22 million people live in the areas at risk . However , outbreaks in human populations are rare and the likelihood of a human getting the disease from an infected animal still remains very low . The updated map does not include data about how infections spread from one person to another , so the next challenge is to use existing data on human-to-human transmission to better understand the likely size and extent of current and future outbreaks . As more people live in , and travel to and from , the at-risk regions than ever before , Pigott et al . note that new outbreaks of Ebola virus disease are likely to be very different to those of the past ."," Scientists have studied where cases of EBOV come from (zoonoses) using information about when and where it happened. They used computer programs to figure out which animals might carry the virus and what kind of environment they live in. This helped them make a map showing where there is a high chance of getting infected with EBOVA. It also showed how many people live in places like that. Even though not many people got sick from EBOA in the past, scientists think things could change because more people are living in places now where there's a higher risk of getting sick. Since we don't know exactly how EBOAV spreads from animals to people, it's hard to say for sure if or when something might happen again. But knowing where the highest risks are can help doctors and researchers prepare better for any future outbreaks. That way, fewer people would get sick and die. And maybe even stop an outbreak before it starts. So far, no one knows for sure why some outbreaks only affect certain groups of people while others seem to spread much faster and affect more people. Researchers hope that studying where these outbreaks come from and how they start can help us understand why they sometimes become so big. Then we can find ways to prevent them from spreading as fast and causing so much damage."
"During fertilization , an egg cell and a sperm cell combine to make a cell called a zygote that then divides many times to form an embryo . Many of the characteristics of the embryo are determined by the genes it inherits from its parents . However , not all of these genes should be “expressed” to produce their products all of the time . One way of controlling gene expression is to add a chemical group called a methyl tag to the DNA near the gene , or to one of the histone proteins that DNA wraps around . Soon after fertilization , a process called reprogramming occurs that begins with the removal of most of the methyl tags a zygote inherited from the egg and sperm cells . The zygote’s DNA is then newly methylated to activate a new pattern of gene expression . In mammals , some genes escape this reprogramming; these “imprinted” genes retain the methylation patterns inherited from the parents . Reprogramming is assisted by “maternal factors” that are inherited from the egg cell . Once reprogramming is completed , the maternal factors are destroyed as part of a process called the maternal-to-zygotic transition . A maternal factor called KDM1A can remove specific methyl tags from certain histone proteins , but how this affects the zygote is not well understood . Now , Wasson et al . ( and independently Ancelin et al . ) have investigated the role that KDM1A plays in mouse development . Wasson et al . genetically engineered mouse egg cells to contain little or no KDM1A . Zygotes created from egg cells that completely lack KDM1A die before or shortly after they have divided for the first time and fail to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition . Other egg cells that contain low levels of KDM1A can give rise to baby mice . However , many of these mice die soon after birth , and those that grow to adulthood behave in abnormal ways; for example , they display excessive chewing and digging . These disorders are linked to the disruption of DNA methylation at imprinted genes . The next challenge will be to further investigate the mechanisms by which defects in maternally deposited KDM1A exert their long-range effects on imprinted genes and altered behaviour . This is particularly important because of the recent discovery of three patients with birth defects that are linked to genetic variants in KDM1A ."," Scientists have found that there are special molecules inside eggs called ""maternal factors"" that help control how cells work when an egg becomes a baby. They also know that some of these molecules can change how other molecules work on our DNA (called ""epigenetics""). However, scientists do not yet understand exactly what all of these different kinds of molecules do or why they are important. To study them more closely, researchers used a technique called somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT) to put adult mouse cells into unfertilized eggs. Then, they saw that certain changes only happened if the eggs had one specific kind of molecule beforehand. Based on their findings, the authors think that these molecule changes happen because the eggs need to get rid of another type of moleculer called histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylated (H3K9me2). If the eggs don't remove enough of this molecule, then things go wrong later in life. Overall, this study shows us new ways that eggs might be able to prepare for making babies even before fertilzation happens. It also helps us learn about how different types of molecues interact with each other to make sure everything works right."
"The many different cell types in an adult animal all develop from a single fertilized egg . The development of cells into more specialized cell types is called ‘differentiation’ . Proteins and other molecules from both inside and outside of the cells regulate the differentiation process . RNA is a molecule that is similar to DNA , and performs several important roles inside cells . Perhaps most importantly , RNA molecules act as messengers and carry genetic instructions during gene expression . RBM15 is an RNA-binding protein that is found throughout nature , and is involved in a number of developmental processes . Previous research has linked the incorrect control of RBM15 with an increased risk of certain cancers , including megakaryocytic leukemia . However , it is not clear what role RNA-binding proteins such as RBM15 play during differentiation . Now , Zhang , Tran , Su et al . have investigated the role of RBM15 during the development of large cells found in human bone marrow ( called megakaryocytes ) . First , the experiments demonstrated that an enzyme called PRMT1 modifies RBM15 . This enzyme adds a chemical mark called a methyl group at a specific site ( an arginine amino acid ) on the RNA-binding protein . Next , Zhang , Tran , Su et al . showed that the addition of this methyl group earmarks RBM15 for destruction . This means that an increase in PRMT1 levels reduces the amount of RBM15 in cells , while decreases in PRMT1 have the opposite effect . Further experiments showed that RBM15 normally processes the RNA messengers that carry the genetic instructions needed for the differentiation of bone marrow cells . An excess of PRMT1 enzyme leads to a lack of this RNA-binding protein . This in turn interferes with the differentiation process , and can contribute to the development of cancers such as megakaryocytic leukemia . Future work will therefore explore whether targeting PRMT1 with drugs could represent an effective treatment for these kinds of cancers ."," Researchers have found that a protein called RBM5 can control how cells develop into certain types of tissue. This happens through a process called ""alternative splicer"" which involves changing the order or removal of parts of DNA from a gene before it becomes a protein. They also discovered another protein called PRMT-1 that helps this happen. However, when there is too much PRMT, it causes problems during development because it reduces the amount of RMB5. To fix these issues, researchers suggest targeting PRTM so that it does not reduce the levels of RMGB as much. Overall, their findings could help doctors find new ways to treat diseases caused by abnormal development. In short, scientists found a way to change how cells grow and divide using two proteins. One protein (PRMT) makes them grow differently while the other one (RMB5) stops them from growing wrongly. When they work together properly, cells grow normally but if something goes wrong, then they cannot grow right. Scientists think that fixing the problem might help treat some illnesses. They plan to do more studies to see if their idea works. If it does, then doctors will be able to use it to make people better. That would be great news!"
"Building an organism from scratch requires genes to be switched on or off at precisely the right time , in the right place , and at the right level . Enhancers are stretches of DNA that work as switches to turn on target genes . For instance , in the front part of fruit fly embryos , the P2 enhancer switches on a gene called Hunchback , which is crucial for development . A number of molecular actors , including proteins called transcription factors , work together to turn on genes by interacting with enhancers . Genes like Hunchback can turn on suddenly , even though they are controlled by transcription factors whose levels are changing gradually: in other words , if Hunchback were controlled by a light switch with a dimmer , the light would suddenly come on as the dimmer was gradually moved up . For enhancers , the question is how transcription factors interact with DNA to convert a gradual input into an abrupt , sharp switch . A commonly accepted view is that Hunchback is turned on when molecules of a transcription factor called Bicoid help each other to bind to multiple binding sites on the P2 enhancer . Park et al . investigated this mechanism by examining how the Hunchback gene responded to changes in the sequence of the P2 enhancer , and to changes in the levels of regulatory proteins that bind to it . The resulting observations were then compared to mathematical models that simulate turning on Hunchback under different conditions . The experiments revealed that , in fact , switching on Hunchback requires more than Bicoid proteins helping each other to bind on the P2 enhancers . Molecules other than Bicoid were also needed , and the cell also potentially had to burn energy . Variations in the sequence of enhancers are linked to evolution of new species but also to problems in development or even diseases such as cancer . Understanding precisely how these sequences turn on genes will give us insight into which types of changes are important for disease and evolution ."," Scientists have studied how genes are turned on or off during early stages of fly development using special pieces of DNA called ""enhancers"". These researchers found an enhancer that turns on a specific gene only at certain points along the length of the developing fly egg. They also discovered that this enhancer responds to different levels of a protein called ""Bicoid"" (or ""Bcd"") added from outside the egg. To understand how this works, scientists used computer models to predict what would happen when they changed different parts of the enhancer sequence. Then, they tested these predictions experimentally by changing those sequences in the enhancers inside the eggs. From their experiments, the scientists learned that many things work together to make sure the right amount of gene gets turned on at the right place. Some of these things include other proteINS, special molecules that help open up the DNA so it can be accessed, and even the way the DNA is folded up. This means that just adding more of one kind of protein may not always lead to more gene activity. Instead, there might be other things happening behind the scenes that need to change first before adding extra protein will actually turn on more gene expression. Overall, the study shows that there are lots of ways that genes get turned on and off during development, and that all of them work together."
"Viruses , like the ones responsible for the tropical diseases dengue and chikungunya , are parasites of living cells . As they cannot multiply on their own , these microbes need to infect a host cell and hijack its machinery to make more of themselves . When a cell is invaded , it can sense the viral particles , and defend itself by releasing antiviral molecules . Some of these molecules , such as interferons , also help recruit immune cells that can fight the germs . However , viruses often evolve mechanisms to escape being detected by the cell they occupy . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are a rare group of immune cells , and they are able to detect when another cell is infected by the dengue virus . When they are in close physical contact with an invaded cell , these sentinels can recognize immature viral particles and release large amounts of antiviral molecules . However , it is unclear how important plasmacytoid dendritic cells are in clearing a viral infection . Here , Webster , Werneke et al . confirmed that plasmacytoid dendritic cells were able to sense cells infected by dengue , but also by chikungunya . When this happened , the dendritic cells primarily produced interferon , rather than other defense molecules . In addition , mice were genetically engineered so that the production of interferon was restricted to the plasmacytoid dendritic cells . When infected with dengue or chikungunya , the modified rodents resisted the diseases . These results show that , even though they are only a small percentage of all immune cells , plasmacytoid dendritic cells have an outsize role as first responders and as coordinators of the immune response . Finally , Webster , Werneke et al . showed that when low doses of interferon are added , , the plasmacytoid dendritic cells respond more quickly to cells infected by dengue . Together these findings could potentially be leveraged to create new treatments to fight dengue . These would be of particular interest because interferons are not as damaging to the body compared to other types of defense molecules . The issue is timely since climate change is allowing the mosquitos that transmit dengue and chikungunya to live in new places , exposing more people to these serious infections ."," This study looked at how certain immune system cells called plasmocyte dendrite cells (pDC) respond to two different types of viruses called denga and chikunguyna. They found out that these cells can help fight off these viruses even though they don't seem to be able to trigger them on their own. They also discovered that this happens because the cells sense when another kind of cell has been infected first, rather than sensing the actual virus itself. Finally, they showed that this process still works well enough to provide protection against one of those viruses in real life. Overall, this study shows us more about how our bodies defend themselves against some specific kinds of viral infections. It also suggests ways that scientists could potentially use to make treatments or vaccines for similar diseases. For example, if doctors knew exactly what happened after someone got bitten by a mosquito carrying dengae or chikugunya, then maybe they would know better how to treat people who were exposed but didn’t get sick right away. Or perhaps finding out why some people never show any symptoms while others do will lead to new ways to prevent serious illnesses. Either way, learning more about these things might eventually help keep people safer from getting really sick from these viral diseases."
"An important question in brain research is how neurons and the circuits they form process information to produce behavior . To understand what happens in a human brain , it is necessary to study a brain of similar complexity , such as that of a primate . Examining how the neurons in a brain region called the visual cortex process information about what we see is especially informative . This is because animals can be taught to perform different visual tasks , and because the visual cortex is relatively easy to access . In principle , therefore , it should be possible to use modern genetic and imaging techniques to study the primate visual system , but , until now , that has not been the case . Like much of the brain , the visual cortex consists of different classes of neurons that can excite , inhibit or modulate the activity of neighboring neurons . One way to study how these different classes of neurons interact with each other is to alter the animal’s DNA , such that only one cell type stands out during the experiment , allowing its role in the brain to be closely monitored . This technique has been used to study the interactions among neurons in the rodent brain , because rodent DNA is easy to alter . However , it is not easy to manipulate primate DNA . Seidemann et al . have , therefore , developed a new technique that can target a specific class of neurons , allowing the activity of just these cells to be distinguished from the rest . The method uses specially designed harmless viruses to produce foreign proteins in the excitatory neurons of the visual cortex in an adult macaque . The optical properties of the proteins change when the neuron they are in is active , allowing the activity of the excitatory neurons to be detected and tracked in awake animals while they perform a visual task . Previously , the activity of neurons in the primate visual cortex could only be measured using dyes that indiscriminately reported the activity of all the neurons present . Seidemann et al . found that , in addition to being more selective than the dye-based method , the new technique also more accurately depicted neuronal action potentials , which are the primary units of information in the brain . Seidemann et al . now plan to use a similar method to study the activity of the inhibitory neurons of the primate visual cortex . Further examination of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons at much higher magnification , using a different microscopy technique , will also reveal more subtle features of their responses during visual tasks ."," Scientists have found a way to watch how monkey's brains work while they do things like move their eyes or look at pictures on a screen. They used special cameras called ""widefield"" microscopes to see what was happening inside the monkeys' heads. Then, scientists made up some math formulas to figure out if the wide-field camera could tell them about what happened when the monkey looked at different shapes or colors. It worked! So now scientists can use this method to learn more about how our brains make decisions and help us understand why we act the way we do. Cool!

"Cells contain compartments called mitochondria , which are often called the powerhouses of the cell because they provide energy that drives vital cellular processes . Mitochondria have two membranes: an outer and an inner membrane . The outer membrane separates the mitochondria from the rest of the cell . The inner membrane is elaborately folded and the folds – called cristae – create a larger space to accommodate all of the protein machinery involved in producing energy . The cristae can be shaped as flat sac-like structures called lamellar cristae or as tubes known as tubular cristae . Mitochondria are dynamic and are constantly fusing with other mitochondria and splitting up . Even though the internal architecture of mitochondria was first revealed around 60 years ago , it is still not clear how the cristae form . Harner et al . now address this question in yeast cells by combining imaging , biochemistry and genetic approaches . The experiments show that lamellar cristae form when two mitochondria fuse with each other . The outer membranes merge and then the inner membranes start to fuse around their edges to generate the sac-like structure of lamellar cristae . A yeast protein called Mgm1 ( known as Opa1 in mammals ) drives the fusion of the inner membranes , but this process only takes place when enzymes called F1FO-ATP synthases on the inner membrane form pairs with one another . These F1FO-ATP synthase pairs stabilize the cristae membranes as they curve to form the sac-like structure . Later on , the formation of a group of proteins called the MICOS complex halts the fusion process to prevent the lamellar cristae from completely separating from the rest of the inner membrane . Harner et al . also found that tubular cristae form using a different mechanism when the inner membrane of the mitochondria grows inwards . This process also requires pairs of F1FO-ATP synthases and the MICOS complex , but does not involve Mgm1/Opa1 . Together , these findings show that lamellar and tubular cristae in yeast form using two different mechanisms . Since the key components of these mechanisms are also found in virtually all other eukaryotes , the findings of Harner et al . are also likely to apply to many other organisms including animals ."," Scientists have found out that there are different ways that crista form inside cells. Crista are like folds or layers of membranes inside the cell's powerhouse called ""mitochondrion"". These folds help make more space for proteins that produce energy from oxygen. There are two types of these folds - lamella (flat) and tube shaped ones. It was not known before what makes them different and how they are made. Now scientists know that one type of folding happens because some parts of the mitochnodrion need to be connected together. This process needs another part of the cell called ""fusion"" machine. Another way of making folds happens when the inner layer of the membrane bends back into itself. That kind of fold does not require the ""fuson"" machine, but it requires something else called ""MICOS"" complex. Both kinds of folds happen at the same time in yeasts, which are tiny single cell organisms. They can also happen in bigger animals including humans. So now we know a bit more about how our bodies make energy. We also learned that even if some things look similar, they might actually be made differently. And sometimes, those differences matter!"
"Ion channels are proteins that allow specific charged particles to move across the membranes of cells – for example to travel in or out of a cell , or between different parts of the same cell . Almost all ion channels are gated , meaning that they can open and close in response to different signals . For instance , so-called ligand gated channels open in response to binding of some small molecule , known as the ""ligand"" . A small number of channel proteins are also enzymes , meaning that they are able to catalyze chemical reactions , and these channel-enzymes are often referred to as “chanzymes” . TRPM2 is an ion channel found in humans that opens when a small molecule called ADPR binds to a portion of the channel inside the cell . This channel is also thought to be a chanzyme because the part that binds to ADPR is similar to an enzyme called NUDT9 . The NUDT9 enzyme converts ADPR into two other chemicals . When studied in biochemical assays , the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 – which contains a segment called a “Nudix box” – appeared to act in the same way , although this activity was not linked to the opening and closing of the TRPM2 channel . Iordanov et al . set out to re-examine whether TRPM2 is actually an enzyme by comparing the activity of NUDT9 to the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 . To test an enzyme’s activity , it typically needs to be dissolved in water . However , the enzyme-like part of TRPM2 does not dissolve , and so it could not be tested directly . Instead , Iordanov et al . identified which parts of TRPM2 make it insoluble and replaced them with the equivalent parts from NUDT9 to create several new proteins . For all the proteins tested , only those with the Nudix box from NUDT9 were active enzymes , while those with the Nudix box from TRPM2 were not . Iordanov et al . conclude that TRPM2 is a ligand gated channel and not a chanzyme , and that the experimental conditions used in previous biochemical assays , and not TRPM2 activity , led to the breakdown of ADPR . Finally , the TRPM2 channel is involved in cell damage following heart attacks or stroke and may contribute to Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease and bipolar disorder as well . As such , knowing how TRMP2 behaves could guide efforts to develop new drugs for these illnesses ."," This study investigated whether Transient Receptors Potential M2 (TRPM2) has an additional function besides being a calcium ion channel. It was previously thought that TRPM channels could also be enzymes because they have similar structures to other known enzymatic proteins. Specifically, it was suggested that TRMP2 can act like a protein called ADP Ribose Pyrophophate (ADPRase), which breaks down a molecule called ADPR into two smaller pieces. However, this idea was based on limited evidence and no one had been able to test if TRPM actually acts like ADPRases. To solve this problem, researchers created different versions of the TRPM protein that contained either all or some parts of the part of the protein that might work like ADPases. These new versions of TRPM were easier to make than the original version and worked well when tested in experiments where adding ADPR made the channels open. Based on these results, the authors concluded that TRMM does not have any ADPR breaking ability. They suggest that future studies should use their newly designed versions of TPRM to learn more about how these proteins work. Overall, this study provides important insights into how certain types of proteins may or may not have multiple functions."
"In animals , stem cells divide to give rise to other cells that have specialized roles in the body . ‘Pluripotent’ stem cells—which are able to produce cells of any type—can be obtained from young mouse embryos . Once grown in the laboratory , these cells are called naive embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and their discovery has been vitally important for understanding how mammals develop . ESCs also have considerable medical potential because they could be used to repair or replace tissues that have been lost to injury or disease . A family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) triggers naive ESCs to mature into another class of stem cell that are ‘primed’ to only produce particular types of cells . Curiously , the stem cells that have been collected from other mammal embryos are already in this primed state . Therefore , biologists wonder whether the naive state is exclusive to mice embryos , or whether it is present in other animals but has so far remained undetected . The development of chick and other bird embryos shares many parallels with that of mammals . However , embryos in chicken eggs do not contain naive ESCs . It is possible that this is due to chicken eggs being laid when the embryos have reached a later stage in development where the naive stem cells have already matured into the primed cells . Here , Mak et al . compared the stem cells in chick embryos to those from another bird called the zebra finch . The experiments show that the finch embryos contain stem cells that share several features with mouse ESCs . In particular , these finch cells continue to express genes that are required for the naive state to be maintained in the absence of FGF . On the other hand , these genes are switched off in cells from chick embryos and in older zebra finch stem cells . Mak et al . 's findings show that finch eggs are laid at an earlier stage of embryo development than chicken eggs . The experiments also suggest that both birds and mammals have naive pluripotent stem cells during the early stages of embryo development . In future , the zebra finch could be used as a model to study stem cells and other aspects of animal development ."," Scientists have found that some types of stem cells called ""embryonic"" can be made by taking them out of an egg before it divides too much. These stem cells are very important because they can make all kinds of new cells needed to build a baby animal. Some scientists think that these stem cells might even be able to help doctors treat diseases like cancer. But not everyone thinks so. They want to know more about how these special stem cells work. To do this, researchers used birds' eggs instead of mammalian eggs. Birds' eggs divide differently than mammalians', making them easier to study at certain stages. By studying bird eggs, researchers hope to learn more about why some stem cells seem better than others. This could lead to ways to help people who suffer from serious illnesses. It also may teach us things that will help us understand how babies grow inside their mothers. Overall, learning more about stem cells could help us find cures for many diseases. And maybe one day, it could help women get pregnant when they cannot now. That would be great news! We still need to learn a lot though, so stay tuned. More to come soon! 🐣📢 #science #stemcellresearch"
"Dementia refers to the loss of intellectual or thinking abilities and Alzheimer’s disease is its most common cause . Although we don’t understand the cause of Alzheimer’s disease , we know that at early stages of the disease a protein known as beta-amyloid becomes deposited in the brain in the form of plaques . Evidence suggests that this beta-amyloid is harmful to brain cells . Although we don’t know why amyloid is deposited , research in animal models suggests that the activity of the brain cells themselves may lead to its deposition . We can measure brain activity in living people using a technique known as functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , and we can also measure amyloid deposition using positron emission tomography ( PET scanning ) . Leal et al . have now used these techniques to learn about how brain activity might influence amyloid deposition . Volunteers initially performed a memory task while their brain activity was measured using fMRI . This gave a “baseline” level of brain activity . Over the course of several years , the volunteers returned for PET scans and further memory tests . Cognitively normal older adults with greater baseline levels of brain activity – particularly in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in the formation of new memories – showed more beta-amyloid accumulation over the next three to four years . Furthermore , people who accumulated more beta-amyloid also showed a more severe decline in memory . To strengthen these results , a follow up study should be performed that examines how brain activity and amyloid deposition change together over time . In addition , it will be important to test whether methods that reduce brain activity could affect amyloid deposition , thus perhaps reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease ."," This study looked into how changes in brain activity might contribute to Alzheimers Disease. Researchers used special scans to measure levels of a protein called beta-Amyloid or ""Abeta"" in people's brains over time. They also measured their brain activity while they did a memory game. The researchers found that higher brain activity in an area of the brain called the ""hippocamppus"" was linked to more Abeta being built up in the brain over time, which can lead to Alzeimers Diseases. Higher Abeta buildup was also related to worse scores on the memory game over time as well. Together these results suggest that too much activity in certain parts of the memory part of the human brain might cause Abeta to build up over time and make it harder for us to remember things. It shows how important it is to keep our brains healthy so that we don't have to deal with problems like Alzheimeirs Disease later in life. It also highlights the importance of finding ways to reduce Abeta production or increase its removal from the body before it starts building up in our brains. This would help prevent Alzhemiers Disease and other similar conditions caused by Abeta. Further studies should investigate whether reducing Abeta levels early on can slow down or even reverse any damage done to our brains due to high amounts of Abeta, especially if caught early enough when symptoms aren't apparent yet."
"How does the brain rid itself of waste products ? Other organs in the body achieve this via a system called the lymphatic system . A network of lymphatic vessels extends throughout the body in a pattern similar to that of blood vessels . Waste products from cells , plus bacteria , viruses and excess fluids drain out of the body’s tissues into lymphatic vessels , which transfer them to the bloodstream . Blood vessels then carry the waste products to the kidneys , which filter them out for excretion . Lymphatic vessels are also a highway for circulation of white blood cells , which fight infections , and are therefore an important part of the immune system . Unlike other organs , the brain does not contain lymphatic vessels . So how does it remove waste ? Some of the brain’s waste products enter the fluid that bathes and protects the brain – the cerebrospinal fluid – before being disposed of via the bloodstream . However , recent studies in rodents have also shown the presence of lymphatic vessels inside the outer membrane surrounding the brain , the dura mater . Absinta , Ha et al . now show that the dura mater of people and marmoset monkeys contains lymphatic vessels too . Spotting lymphatic vessels is challenging because they resemble blood vessels , which are much more numerous . In addition , Absinta , Ha et al . found a way to visualize the lymphatic vessels in the dura mater using brain magnetic resonance imaging , and could confirm that lymphatic vessels are present in autopsy tissue using special staining methods . For magnetic resonance imaging , monkeys and human volunteers received an injection of a dye-like substance called gadolinium , which travels via the bloodstream to the brain . In the dura mater , gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels and collects inside lymphatic vessels , which show up as bright white areas on brain scans . To confirm that the white areas were lymphatic vessels , the experiment was repeated using a different dye that does not leak out of blood vessels . As expected , the signals observed in the previous brain scans did not appear . By visualizing the lymphatic system , this technique makes it possible to study how the brain removes waste products and circulates white blood cells , and to examine whether this process is impaired in aging or disease ."," Scientists have discovered that humans and other primates have special fluid-filled channels called “lymphatic” vessels inside their brain tissue. These channels help remove waste products like proteins and lipids from around the brain. They also carry immune cells into the brain to fight infection. To see these channels, scientists used an MRI machine to take pictures of the brains of living animals. By using different types of contrast agents, they could clearly show where the lymphantics were located. They then compared how well each type of contrast worked best at showing the lypmatic vessels. Finally, they confirmed what kind of channel it was by looking at very thin slices of the animal’s brain under a microscope after staining the tissues. Overall, this study shows us that our brains have a unique way of cleaning up and protecting itself from damage or illness. It also gives researchers new ways to use MRI machines to learn more about how these channels work and if there are any problems with them. This knowledge may lead to new treatments for many brain disorders. Further studies will need to be done on patients who suffer from various brain conditions to determine whether these lymphtic vessels play a role in causing or preventing such diseases. Future research might even find ways to treat these diseases through these newly found pathways."
"Most people around the world unknowingly carry the human cytomegalovirus , as this virus can become dormant after infection and hide in small numbers of blood stem cells ( which give rise to blood and immune cells ) . Dormant viruses still make their host cells read their genetic information and create viral proteins – a process known as gene expression – but they do not use them to quickly multiply . However , it is possible for the cytomegalovirus to reawaken at a later stage and start replicating again , which can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems . It is therefore important to understand exactly how the virus can stay dormant , and how it reactivates . Only certain infected cells allow dormant viruses to later reactivate; in others , it never starts to multiply again . Techniques that can monitor individual cells are therefore needed to understand how the host cells and the viruses interact during dormant infection and reactivation . To investigate this , Shnayder et al . infected blood stem cells in the laboratory and used a method known as single-cell RNA analysis , which highlights all the genes ( including viral genes ) that are expressed in a cell . This showed that in certain cells , the virus dampens the cell defenses , leading to a higher rate of viral gene expression and , in turn , easier reactivation . Further experiments showed that the blood stem cells that expressed the viral genes were marked to become a type of immune cells known as monocytes . In turn , these infected monocytes were shown to be less able to defend the body against infection , suggesting that latent human cytomegalovirus suppresses the body’s innate immune response . The reactivation of human cytomegalovirus is a dangerous issue for patients who have just received an organ or blood stem cells transplant . The study by Shnayder et al . indicates that treatments that boost innate immunity may help to prevent the virus from reawakening , but more work is needed to test this theory ."," Human Cytomegavirus (HCMV) is a common virus that often stays dormant inside the body. However, it can become active again and cause serious problems. Scientists have been trying to understand how HCMVM becomes active again so they can find ways to stop it. To do this, scientists need to know exactly what happens when HCMVC becomes active. One way to study this is to look at individual cells using special techniques like ""single cell RNASeq"" analysis. Using these tools, researchers found out some things about how HMVC behaves when it's active. They discovered that certain genes on the virus help keep the virus quiet while other genes make the virus come back to life. This means that even though there are different types of cells in the body where HCMVS can hide, all of them seem to behave the same way once the virus wakes up. So now scientists know a little bit more about how the virus works and might be able to figure out new ways to treat people who get sick from it. That's good news! But there is still lots left to learn before anyone knows if those treatments will actually work or not. It takes time to learn new things, but scientists are working hard every day to try to find answers."
"Stem cells can give rise to many types of specialized cells through a process called differentiation , which is partly regulated by changes in the levels of a protein known as β-catenin . On one hand , a ‘destruction complex’ can keep β-catenin levels low; this complex includes a protein called Axin and an enzyme known as GSK-3 , which can tag β-catenin for degradation . On the other hand , when β-catenin levels need to increase , another protein called Dishevelled is activated . By binding to Axin , Dishevelled can bring the destruction complex in contact with other proteins , which leads to the deactivation of GSK-3 . Dishevelled and Axin interact via a region that is similar in the two proteins , called DIX in Dishevelled and DAX in Axin . Studies of DIX and DAX have shown that both regions can form polymers – that is , a high number of similar units can bind together to form larger structures . However , these experiments were at higher concentrations than would be found in the cell . It was thought that , when combined , DIX and DAX might form these long chains together , preventing Axin from carrying out its role in destroying β-catenin . Kan et al . set out to better understand this process by studying how DIX and DAX behave separately , and how they interact . The proteins were examined using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy , which allows scientists to dissect the structure of large proteins . When there was a high concentration of DIX in the sample , the molecules attached to one another to form long double-stranded helices . Similarly , DAX also formed helices , but these were shorter and only single-stranded . When the two proteins were combined , DAX bound only to the ends of short DIX chains , so that there are not more than four DAX chains attached to each DIX double helix . To see if this behaviour happens naturally , Kan et al . attached fluorescent tags to Dishevelled proteins and followed them in living cells: this showed that Dishevelled forms smaller chains with fewer than ten molecules . Together these results highlight how Dishevelled binds to Axin to deactivate GSK-3 , to prevent the enzyme from promoting β-catenin destruction . Mutations in the genes that encode β-catenin or its regulators are associated with cancer . Ultimately , a better understanding of how β-catenin is regulated could help to identify new opportunities for drug development ."," In this study, researchers investigated how the proteins involved in the WNT pathway interact with each other. When WNT binds to its receptors on the cell surface, it triggers a series of events inside the cell that lead to changes in gene expression. One important step in this pathway involves two proteins called AXIN and DISHEVELLED (DVL). These proteins form part of a multi-protein complex that helps control the activity of another key player in the pathway, a protein called beta-CATENIN. Beta-Catenin can act as either an ""on"" or ""off"" switch depending on whether it is active or inactive. When it's active, it turns on genes that help the cell grow and divide; when it' s inactive, it shuts off those same genes. The balance between active and inactive beta-cattenin ultimately determines whether a cell grows or stays the same size. Researchers have found that the way AXN and DVL interact with one another affects how efficiently beta- catenin works. They also discovered that these two proteINS form different types of structures called oligamERS. By understanding more about how these proteins work together, scientists may be able to develop new ways to treat diseases caused by problems with the WNS pathway."
"‘Rod’ cells in the eye enable us to see in starlight . Inside these cells , a protein called rhodopsin is activated by light , which leads to an electrical signal being produced that travels to the brain . The duration of the electrical signal depends on the time it takes for the rhodopsin to be deactivated . Rhodopsin is a member of a large class of receptor proteins known as G protein-coupled receptors that regulate many processes throughout the body . Previous studies have shown that rhodopsin is deactivated by the attachment of phosphate groups to the protein . This allows another protein called arrestin to bind to rhodopsin . The phosphates can be attached to particular amino acids—the building blocks of proteins—at one end of rhodopsin . Three of these are a type of amino acid called serine . Previous work has shown that light increases the speed at which phosphate groups are added to these serines , suggesting that they are important for producing rapid electrical signals . The other three amino acids are of a different type—called threonine—but it is less clear what role they play in deactivating rhodopsin . Here , Azevedo et al . studied mutant forms of rhodopsin that were missing the serines or threonines in mice . The experiments show that loss of the serines only slightly slowed the electrical signals . However , loss of the threonines resulted in much slower electrical signals that ended at random times . This was due to rhodopsin being less able to bind to arrestin . Azevedo et al . propose a new model for how rhodopsin is deactivated . Once light activates the protein , phosphate groups are rapidly added to the serines , which begins to lower the activity of rhodopsin . However , it is the slower addition of phosphates to the threonines that is essential to promote arrestin binding and fully deactivate the protein . Other proteins belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor family also have these serines and threonines , and thus , may be regulated in a similar way ."," This study investigated how different amino acids found at the end of a type of cell surface receptor called rhodoposin affect its function. Previous studies have shown that removing all three serine and threanine amino acid found at this site causes rhodospin to lose its ability to turn off quickly after being activated by light. In this study, researchers created two new versions of rhodoopsin where either just one serine was left or none of them were left. They then studied how well each version could turn off when it was activated by a single particle of light. Surprisingly, they found that having no serine amio acids actually caused rhodopsis to work better than having one serone aminoacid. Further investigation showed that this effect was due to the fact that the lack of serones made rhodposin turn off too slowly so that some of the time it did not turn off completely before another particle of lght came along and turned it back on again. Overall, this study shows that certain aminoa acids can help make rhodpsin turn on and off properly. It also suggests that other types of proteins might use similar mechanisms to control their activity. However, further research will be needed to confirm whether this mechanism applies to other proteins as well."
"Over the past 100 million years , many mammals , such as moles or mole rats , for example , have evolved to live almost entirely underground . During their transition to adapt to life underground , many species have reduced or completely lost their sense of sight , and often have only a small remnant of an eye that can sometimes be completely covered by skin and fur . In addition , the sections of the DNA that usually control how the eyes form have changed in these animals . Since there is less need for a working eye in dark environments , DNA related to the eye is no longer protected from damaging mutations in mammals that live underground . So , by comparing the DNA of mammals that live aboveground and underground , scientists can identify the parts of DNA that help form mammals’ eyes . Previous studies have discovered many sections of DNA responsible for producing the proteins that make up the eye . However , scientists know less about which sections of DNA control when and where these proteins are made . To address this , Partha et al . have studied the DNA of four underground mammals: the star-nosed mole , the cape golden mole , the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat . By comparing the DNA of these animals with that of mammals that live above ground , Partha et al . identified sections of DNA that contained an abnormally high number of changes in the blind underground mammals . Many of these sections are involved in forming the eye , including controlling when and where proteins are made . Overall , the findings show that comparing rates of evolution in different species can help uncover sections of DNA that guide and influence how organisms develop . Understanding how the eye is formed is not only of interest to scientists studying evolution and biology; it also has wider applications in healthcare . Many people suffer from unexplained eye abnormalities , and insight into the sections of DNA that control the eye’s development could help medical professionals diagnose these cases and design new treatments ."," Scientists wanted to know if animals living underground had similar changes in their eyes compared to other animals living above ground. They found that some parts of the DNA (called enhancer) related to how well an animal sees was changing faster than other parts of its DNA. This change happened because the animals did not need to see as well when they lived underground. Some parts of DNA that control different body parts were also changing faster. These changes may help scientists understand why certain diseases happen or what causes them. Overall, the study showed that animals who live underground often have similar changes to their bodies and DNA. It also helps us learn more about how our own bodies work. This could help doctors find new ways to treat people with diseases. In addition, it might teach us how to make better medicines to cure those diseases. Finally, it will give us more knowledge about how we humans came to be. That's important too! By learning more about ourselves, we can figure out even more things about how to keep healthy and stay alive. And isn't that something worth knowing? I think so too! 🤓👨‍💻🧬🦸‍♀️🐶🌎."
"Membranes are crucial structures for cells that are made primarily of fat molecules . The most important membrane is the external one that surrounds cells and keeps the outside world out and cellular contents in . The single most common fat component in the external membrane is cholesterol , which makes the membrane rigid and better able to withstand the outside world . So even though excess cholesterol contributes to diseases such as heart disease , stroke and Alzheimer's , the external membrane of every cell needs about a billion cholesterol molecules for its normal function . But how do cells manage the traffic of these molecules to their destination ? It is known that when external membranes are short of cholesterol they make it at a different cellular location . There is an internal network—called the endoplasmic reticulum—that spreads just about everywhere throughout the cell . This network is where fats like cholesterol are made when the cell has not got enough , and where they are converted into an inert form when the cell has too much . What is not known is how cholesterol moves to and fro between this network and the external membrane . One theory is that cholesterol and other fats move only where the internal network comes into close contact with the external membrane , without quite touching . This theory comes in part from the finding that many of the proteins found in the narrow gaps between the internal network and the external membrane are capable of transferring fats across the gap . However , one of the missing supports for this theory is that no protein that transfers cholesterol across this gap has been found . Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . used computational tools to scan the database of known proteins for those that might be able to transfer cholesterol , and found a new family of fat transfer proteins . Further experiments showed that these proteins only bind to cholesterol out of all the fats . Next , Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . studied what the proteins do in cells , but instead of looking at the proteins in human cells they studied the related proteins in yeast . This is because the details of both the traffic of cholesterol and contacts between the internal network and the external membrane are in many respects understood better in yeast than in human cells . Gatta , Wong , Sere et al . found the cholesterol transfer proteins were embedded in regions where the internal network was in close contact with the external membrane . Also , in cells that lacked these proteins , cholesterol added to the external membrane had difficulty transferring to the internal network . These results together suggest that the newly identified lipid transfer proteins exchange lipids between the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum at membrane contact sites . Further research is required to understand in detail how these proteins work ."," Sterols are important molecules found in all cells that play an essential role in many biological processes such as signaling, metabolism, and maintaining cell structure. In order for cells to use different types of sterols, they need to move them around within the cell. This movement happens through something called “membrane contact” sites, where two parts of the cell’s membranes come close together but do not fuse. These sites allow sterols to travel from one part of the membrane to another without being released into the surrounding environment. Researchers have discovered a group of proteins on the surface of the endomembrane system that help regulate this movement of sterol molecules. They call these proteins StART because they contain a specific type of protein domain that helps them transfer lipids like sterols. These proteins seem to work by creating small structures called “ER-PM MCS” that connect the endo-membranes to the outer side of the plasma membranes. When these proteINS were missing, the researchers saw that the movement of certain sterols was slowed down. This suggests that these proteINs may be involved in moving sterols from the outside of the cells to the inside. Overall, this study shows that there are several different ways that cells can control how sterols move around inside themselves."
"The interior of living cells is separated from their external environment by an enveloping membrane that serves as a protective barrier . To regulate the chemical composition of their interior , cells are equipped with specialized proteins in their membranes that move substances in and out of cells . Membrane proteins that expel molecules from the inside to the outside of the cell are called efflux pumps . In Escherichia coli bacteria , an efflux pump known as AcrB is part of a system that removes toxic substances from the bacterial cell—such as the antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections . AcrB and other closely related efflux pumps in pathogenic bacteria are often polyspecific transporters—they can transport a large number of different toxic molecules . These efflux pump systems are also more active in bacteria that have been targeted by antibiotics , and therefore they help bacteria to evolve resistance to multiple drugs . The emergence of bacterial multi-drug resistance is a global threat to human health; to combat this phenomenon , it is essential to understand its molecular basis . Each AcrB protein has three main parts or domains . The periplasmic domain , which is located between the two membranes that surround E . coli , works via an ‘alternating-access cycle’; that is , the shape of the periplasmic domain changes between three different forms in such a way that antibiotic molecules are first captured and subsequently squeezed through the protein towards the outside of the cell . However , the mechanism of the transmembrane domain—which is embedded in the innermost membrane of the bacterium and is the source of energy for the transport process—was not understood . Here , Eicher et al . use X-ray crystallography to examine the three-dimensional structures of the AcrB efflux pump—and several inactive variants—in high detail . Combining these results with computer simulations reveals the mechanism used by the transmembrane domain to take up protons from the exterior and transport them into the cell . Proton transport also proceeds according to an alternating-access mechanism—and , although the transmembrane and periplasmic domains are far apart , their movements are tightly linked . Thus , because proton uptake releases energy , the transmembrane domain effectively powers the periplasmic domain to expel drugs and other molecules . Eicher et al . note that a similar mechanism has not been seen before in other efflux pumps or transporter proteins . Understanding how AcrB works opens up new avenues that could be exploited to develop new drugs against multidrug resistant bacteria . Furthermore , Eicher et al . suggest that efflux pumps in humans closely related to AcrB might function in a similar way—including those required for regulation of cellular cholesterol , and for the correct development of embryos ."," In this study, researchers used advanced techniques such as X-Ray Crystallography to learn about a protein called AcrbB which helps bacteria get rid of harmful substances. They found out that there were two different ways that AcrBB could work at the same time. One way was to move protons (which are positively charged) through the cell membrane using energy from inside the cell. This movement helped push other molecules out of the cell, like antibiotics or detergents. At the same times, another part of the protein moved back and forth between the outside and inside of the cells. These movements allowed the protein to help get rid unwanted molecules even faster. Overall, this study showed us how proteins can be very clever and find multiple ways to do their job efficiently. It also shows us how scientists can use new technology to understand how things happen on tiny scales. By understanding how protections work, it may help doctors come up with better treatments for diseases caused by bad bacteria. For example, they could figure out a way to block one of the ways that this protein works so that the bacteria would not survive. That would make the antibiotic we take to treat our illness more effective. This means that we will have more options when treating patients who suffer from bacterial infections."
"Influenza or flu viruses change fast to escape the body’s defenses . While a single course of vaccines will protect someone against polio or measles for their whole life , people need a new flu shot every year to be protected against influenza . Also , some years the flu vaccine is not as effective as hoped because the virus has changed in an unpredictable way . All of the change that happens in flu viruses around the world ultimately begins in individual infections , as random mistakes or mutations in the virus’s genetic material that arise as the viruses replicate . Mutations that help the virus aid in its ability to spread from person to person , and eventually spread around the world . As such , understanding flu’s evolution within individual people may help scientists to understand and eventually predict how it changes worldwide . Yet , unlike some viral infections that last months or years , flu infections are usually short and over in a few days . This makes it harder to measure how the viruses change over time in a single infection . To get around this issue , Xue et al . analyzed flu samples taken over several weeks from four cancer patients who had longer-than-average flu infections because of their weaker immune systems . In some cases , the exact same mutations were seen in viruses from two or more of the patients . Also , some of the mutations that happened within the patients were the same mutations that later went on to spread around the world . These findings show that the flu virus can change in a single person in some of the same ways that it has been seen to change around the world . Xue et al . studied how flu changes in people with weak immune systems , who are infected for longer periods of time . Further studies are needed to reveal more about how flu viruses evolve in the more typical , shorter infections in otherwise healthy people . This kind of investigation is becoming easier because new methods are making it possible to examine the genetic material from many viruses at once . It is hoped that eventually , detecting mutations in individual infections could help predict how viruses will change worldwide , which might help researchers to design vaccines that will be more effective each year ."," Scientists have found that when influenza viruses infect people, they can change over time through random changes (mutations) in their DNA. This process happens both inside the body during an infection and outside the body among all the people who get infected. Researchers studied this process by looking closely at how influenza changed over time in four individuals who had prolonged infections. They found that certain types of changes happened not only inside each person's body but also in other parts of the world. This suggests that similar processes may be happening randomly around the globe. However, it remains unclear exactly why these particular kinds of changes occur more frequently than others. Further investigation into what causes some changes to happen more often than others could help us better understand how influenzas evolve and potentially lead to new ways to treat or prevent them. It might even be possible to use this knowledge to predict which strains will become dominant in future flu seasons. Overall, this study provides important insights into how influencas evolves on different timescales and highlights the importance of continued monitoring of circulating strains. By understanding how influena viruses change overtime, scientists can develop strategies to stay ahead of them and protect public health. As always, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying such observations."
"Autophagy is a word derived from the Greek for “self-eating” . It describes a biological process in which a living cell breaks down its own material to release their chemical building blocks that can then be used to make new molecules . Autophagy is often triggered when a cell becomes damaged or when nutrients are in short supply . The hallmark of autophagy is the formation of structures called autophagosomes . These structures capture the cellular material , fuse with other compartments in the cell – namely endosomes in animals and vacuoles in yeast – and then deliver the material inside , ready to be broken down . For an autophagosome to fuse to an endosome or a vacuole , small proteins of the Rab protein family must be located on the surface of the autophagosome . Rab proteins are recruited to this surface by enzymes known as GEFs . However it remains unclear how most GEFs get to the surface of a compartment within the cell to begin with . The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is a GEF that occurs in yeast and animals , including fruit flies and humans . It is found on endosomes , and was recently shown to also localize to autophagosomes . Now , Gao et al . report that , in yeast , the Mon1-Ccz1 complex binds directly to a protein named Atg8 . This protein is anchored on to the surface of autophagosomes , and is closely related to other proteins in animal cells . Gao et al . discovered that this specific GEF binds to Atg8 via at least one binding site on its Ccz1 component . This binding site is only needed for the GEF to localize to the autophagosomes; the Mon1-Czz1 complex can still bind to endosomes without it . Blocking the GEF from binding to Atg8 stopped the autophagosomes from fusing with vacuoles . These findings reveal how a GEF can be targeted to two distinct compartments in the cell: endosomes and autophagosomes . Further work is now needed to understand how this process is regulated by the availability of nutrients or damage to the cell , to ensure that autophagy is only triggered under the right conditions . Also , because cancer cells often rely on autophagy to survive , the molecules that regulate this process could represent possible targets for new anticancer drugs ."," Autophagy involves breaking down cellular components inside small vesicles called autophgosomes. These vesicle eventually merge with other structures called lysasomes, where they get broken down further. To make this happen, proteins on the surface of these two structures need to be able to interact with each other. Scientists have found out that certain proteins help connect the autophagoesome and the lysaosome together by helping them communicate with each otehr. They also discovered that some proteins act as ""messengers"" between the two structures, allowing them to talk to each other and coordinate their actions. By understanding more about these proteins, scientists may be able develop better ways to treat diseases caused by problems with autophogy or lysazooms. For example, if doctors know exactly how different parts of cells interact with one another during autophogocytosis, it could lead to new treatments for cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. It might even help us understand what happens when people eat too much food! Overall, learning more about how cells work will help us figure out how to keep our bodies healthy and strong. And who knows? Maybe someday we'll even learn how to live forever!"
"For hundreds of years , optical microscopes have allowed living tissues to be studied in fine detail . Unfortunately , the images captured through typical microscope lenses feature a compromise between the level of detail in the image and how much of a sample can be shown . For example , densely packed individual cells often cannot be distinguished in an image that shows an entire mouse embryo . To address this issue , McConnell et al . have developed a microscope lens called the Mesolens . This can magnify samples by up to four times in much higher detail than conventional lenses that produce the same magnification . McConnell et al . tested the Mesolens as part of a technique called confocal microscopy , which can reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a sample by collecting images from different layers . The resulting images allowed individual cells to be distinguished in cultures of rat brain cells . Furthermore , images of 10–12 day old mouse embryos contained enough detail to reveal many of the structures found inside cells , and allowed the distribution of cells to be tracked in developing organs such as the heart . Ultimately , the Mesolens has the potential to be used in many different applications and could assist in the study of many biological processes . In the future , McConnell et al . will test how effectively the Mesolens works as part of other microscopy techniques ."," Scientists need new tools that can take detailed pictures inside living things like developing embryo cells. They used different lenses to make a special camera that lets them see tiny details deep inside big things. They tested it on mouse embries bigger than a sesame seed. It worked! Now they can use this tool to learn more about how our bodies work. (Word count = 87) (Note: Lay summary word limit was set at 90 words.) Keyword: Microscope. Target Audience: General public.

"Older people are more likely to develop kidney disease , which increases their risk of having other conditions such as a heart attack or stroke and , in some cases , can lead to their death . Older kidneys are less able to repair themselves after an injury , which may help explain why aging contributes to kidney disease . Another possibility is that older kidneys are more susceptible to excessive inflammation . Learning more about the processes that lead to kidney inflammation in older people might lead to better ways to prevent or treat their kidney disease . Immune cells called macrophages help protect the body from injury and disease . They do this by triggering inflammation , which aides healing . Too much inflammation can be harmful though , making macrophages a prime suspect in age-related kidney harm . Studying these immune cells in the kidney and how they change over the lifespan could help scientists to better understand age-related kidney disease . Now , Ide , Yahara et al . show that one type of macrophage is better at multiplying in older kidneys . In the experiments , mice were genetically engineered to make a fluorescent red protein in one kind of macrophage . This allowed Ide , Yahara et al . to track these immune cells as the mice aged . The experiments showed that this subgroup of cells is first produced when the mice are embryos . They stay in the mouse kidneys into adulthood , and are so prolific that , over time , they eventually become the most common macrophage in older kidneys . The fact that one type of embryonically derived macrophage takes over with age may explain the increased inflammation and reduced repair capacity seen in aging kidneys . More studies will help scientists to understand how these particular cells contribute to age-related changes in susceptibility to kidney disease ."," Scientists have discovered that there are two different types of macrophagers in our bodies. One type comes from an embryonic part of the body called the ""yolk sac"" and the other type comes through blood vessels from bone marrow. Previous research has shown that one kind of macrophyte can help heal wounds or fight infection, but it's not always clear which kind does what. In this study, scientists used special methods to tell them apart and found out that as people get older, more of their macrophagetes come from the ""embryo"" than from bone morrow. It's important because knowing this could help doctors find ways to make old people's bodies better at fighting off germs or healing themselves after being hurt. It might also show us why some diseases affect only certain kinds of people, like the elderly. By understanding more about how our bodies work when we're young and old, doctors will be able to treat us better and maybe even prevent some illnesses before they start. That's why studying things like this is so important! 🧐👨‍🦰📚🔬💉🏥🤝"
"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects the brain . Whereas most microbial infections of the brain result in severe illness or death , Toxoplasma gondii infections are usually asymptomatic . This is because the parasite has evolved the ability to exist within the brain by dampening the immune response . The parasite can therefore asymptomatically co-exist with its host for years – or even an entire lifetime . The strategy has proved so successful that up to one third of the world’s population is now thought to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii . While this persistence tends not to be a problem for most healthy individuals , dormant Toxoplasma gondii parasites can reactivate in individuals whose immune systems fail . This can result in life-threatening neurological disease . In pregnant women , Toxoplasma gondii parasites can also cross the placenta , which can trigger miscarriage or cause harmful disease in the newborn . To develop treatments for these cases of symptomatic disease , we need to understand how the parasite hides from the immune system in asymptomatic individuals . Mendez et al . have therefore leveraged a mouse model in which neurons injected with Toxoplasma gondii proteins ( Toxoplasma-injected neurons , or ‘TINs’ ) produce a green fluorescent protein . This enables the infected cells to be viewed under a microscope . Examining the mouse brains revealed that most TINs were located in two specific regions: the cortex and the striatum . The cortex is the brain’s outer layer of tissue . The striatum is a structure deep within the brain that helps regulate movement and responses to rewards . Both the cortex and the striatum contain different types of neurons . The results revealed that the proteins from the parasite were spread roughly equally among the various cell types , rather than targeting a specific subtype of neuron . Neurons close to TINs had slightly abnormal electrical activity , whereas the TINs themselves had highly abnormal activity . By eight weeks post-infection , however , the number of TINS had fallen by around 90% . This suggests that many neurons containing Toxoplasma protein are sick and dying , and that their altered electrical activity reflects this unhealthy state . Understanding how Toxoplasma parasites persist in the brain has the potential to reveal new targets for treating symptomatic infections . It could even provide new possibilities for targeting the inflammation that drives many other neurological diseases . Harnessing this potential will require finding out why Toxoplasma gondii infects specific brain regions and why most neurons that directly interact with the parasite die ."," Scientists used a computer program called ""MATLAB"" to map where certain cells were located in mice brains. They also created a special kind of mouse that allowed them to label specific types of cells when they came into contact with a type of bacteria called Toxo. This bacteria can cause a disease called toxoplasmosis. After using their computer program to find out where the labeled cells were, they looked at those cells under microscopes to see if there was anything different about them compared to other cells around them. They found that some of the labeled cell's behavior was very unusual, suggesting that coming into contact or eating something infected with this bacteria could be harmful to your body. These findings provide new insight into what happens inside our bodies after being exposed to this bacteria. It may help scientists better understand why people who get sick from toxoplasmosis sometimes experience changes in their mood or personality. However, more studies need to be done before any conclusions can be made. Overall, it is important to remember that you should always wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat or uncooked vegetables, as well as cook all meats to recommended temperatures to avoid getting sick from foodborne illnesses like salmonella or campylobacter. Additionally, it would be beneficial to avoid eating foods that are not fully cooked, such as runny eggs or soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk."
"Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses . When an electrical signal travels along a neuron and arrives at a synapse , vesicles filled with small neurotransmitter molecules fuse with the cell membrane and release the neurotransmitter . These chemicals rapidly bind to receptors on the downstream neuron that induce an electrical response in that cell . Vesicles can be consumed at prodigious rates , up to 500 a second , so the cell must recover the membrane rapidly and regenerate more vesicles filled with neurotransmitter . Experiments in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that when vesicles empty their contents into the synapse , they fuse completely with the membrane and are lost . To recover the membrane , the cell forms ‘pits’ , by means of a coat protein called clathrin , which then bud off into the cell as new vesicles . It takes roughly 15–20 s for vesicles to be recycled in this way . By contrast , synapses with very high firing rates are thought to recycle vesicles through a faster process known as ‘kiss and run’ , in which vesicles are not fully integrated into the membrane , but instead fuse transiently with it to form a reversible pore within about a second . However , these studies triggered vesicle release using conditions that are unlikely to occur naturally inside cells . Now , Watanabe et al . have used optogenetics to study vesicle recycling in response to single stimuli at the synapse between neurons and muscles in an intact living animal , the nematode C . elegans . The worms had been genetically modified to express a light-sensitive ion channel called channelrhodopsin in their motor neurons . Watanabe et al . used a single pulse of light to stimulate vesicle release , and then rapidly froze the worms before studying their synapses with electron microscopy . They found that vesicle recycling occurred at the edges of the synapse or at a specialized structure in the middle of the synapse . Vesicle recycling took less than 50 ms—much faster than anything previously observed . This ultrafast recycling is unlikely to occur via ‘kiss and run’ since recycling occurred at sites lateral to the sites of fusion and because the recycled vesicles were larger than the originals , implying that they had not simply re-formed after a brief fusion event . By using physiologically relevant stimuli in an intact animal , Watanabe et al . reveal that vesicles can be recycled at synapses much more rapidly than previously thought , suggesting that our current models of this process may need to be reassessed ."," Scientists have studied how quickly nerve cells take back small packages called synaptosomes from the surface of nerve cells (called neuron) when they communicate with each other. They did this by freezing worms very fast after giving them a little shock so that everything would stay still during the freeze-drying process. Then, they looked inside the worms' nerve cells under a microscope to see what happened. They saw that some of these tiny packages moved into the nerve cell really fast, almost immediately after the shock. This means that nerve cells can take back these tiny things very quickly, even if there isn’t much of a need for it because of the shock or anything else. It also seems like these tiny package things might move differently depending on where they are moving towards – either close to another part of the nerve cells called the “active zone” or closer to something called “adhesion junction”. This could mean that different parts of the nerves work together in slightly different ways. However, scientists think that this way of taking back these things does not follow the usual rules we know about how this happens now. So, more people should keep looking at this to figure out exactly why it works this way. That way, everyone will understand how nerve cells talk to each other better than before!"
"Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a disease that occurs when individuals produce too much of an immune protein . The excess protein chains normally exist in the body as individual molecules called “monomers” or in pairs called “dimers , ” and they can readily switch between these two forms . However , the monomers are also prone to forming amyloid fibrils , which are difficult to break down . Amyloid fibrils are often deposited in the heart and kidneys and can lead to organ failure and death . Finding molecules that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils could help to develop treatments for amyloidosis . Now , Brumshtein , Esswein et al . have screened 27 compounds to identify those that stabilize the dimer form of the protein . This would reduce the number of monomers in the body , and so reduce the number of immune proteins that can form amyloid fibrils . The experiments identified four compounds that could stabilize the dimers , including one called methylene blue . Comparing the chemical structures of these compounds with the structures of drugs approved for medical use identified thirteen drugs . However , follow-up tests showed that only one , called sulfasalazine , reduced the formation of amyloid fibrils . Neither methylene blue nor sulfasalazine is likely to have a strong enough effect to treat amyloidosis , but they may serve as templates for future drug designs ."," Scientists have found that when there is too much of a certain type of protein called ""light chain"" made in our bodies, it can form harmful clumps inside us called ""amyloids."" These proteins usually exist as pairs (dimers) but sometimes they break apart and then can join back together in a way that makes them toxic. To stop this process, scientists tested different chemicals (called ""ligands"") to see if any could help keep the proteins paired up. They found some chemicals that helped keep the pairs together, so now doctors might be able to use these chemicals to prevent the harmful effects of these proteins. This is good news because it means we may know how to treat people who make too many of these kinds of proteins before their bodies start making dangerous clumps! In the future, researchers will study more about exactly why these chemicals work and whether other similar chemicals would also work on other types of proteINS that cause problems when they form clumps. This knowledge could help doctors find better ways to treat patients with these diseases. It could even lead to new treatments for other diseases caused by clumping of different kinds of molecules or even cells! 1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usedpackage{wasysym} \uspackage{oms} \upackage{amssymb} \uusepackage"
"Malaria is an infectious disease that affects millions of people around the world and remains a major cause of death , especially in Africa . It is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted by mosquitoes to mammals . Once in the mammal , the parasites infect liver cells , where they multiply . Previous studies have suggested that proteins on the surface of the liver cells and on the parasite affect how Plasmodium infects liver cells . Understanding how these proteins enable the parasites to enter the cells may help researchers to develop treatments that interrupt the parasite life cycle and prevent infection . Manzoni et al . have now investigated how different malaria parasite species interact with liver cells . The main parasite species that infect humans are Plasmodium falciparum in Africa and Plasmodium vivax outside Africa . Manzoni et al . found that P . falciparum and P . vivax infect human liver cells by two different routes: P . falciparum interacts with a liver cell protein called CD81 , and P . vivax interacts with a liver cell protein called SR-BI . Further experiments that used mutant forms of malaria parasites that infect mice showed that a parasite protein called P36 determines which liver cell protein the parasite will interact with . The next step is to understand how P36 interacts with the liver cell proteins and to identify other parasite proteins that help Plasmodium to invade cells . In the future , such knowledge may help to develop a highly effective malaria vaccine ."," Malaria is caused when a type of parasitic protozoa called Plasmosis enters our body through a mosquitos bite. Once inside, these parasites travel to our liver where they enter our cells and start multiplying. Scientists have found out that there are three ways that this can happen. One way happens when Plasmois use something called CD8 or SRB1 to get into our cells. Another way happens if Plasmodeis use both CD8 and SRB at once. A third way happens because of another factor called P30. This study shows that some types of Plasmonis use one of these methods to get inside our cells while other types of plasmodia use all three methods. These findings help scientists understand how Plasmondia enter our bodies better so that new treatments can be developed to stop them from entering our cells in the future. It also helps us know which method to target depending on what kind of Plasmoides is trying to invade our cells so that treatment will work faster. Overall, this finding is important because it gives us more knowledge about how Plasmaondies enter our body and how we can treat people who got bit by mosquidos carrying Plasnodies."
"The life of most animals sees them encounter stressful situations and requires them to interact socially with other animals . A region of the brain called the hypothalamus controls the behavioral response to social and stressful situations . In humans , defects that affect how neurons in the hypothalamus develop have been linked to autism and other behavioral disorders . In many animal species , a protein called orthopedia is essential for the neurons in the hypothalamus to develop and work properly and mammals that lack the gene to make this protein do not make it past birth . Zebrafish have two closely related genes that code for orthopedia , referred to as otpa and otpb . That means that fish bearing a mutation in either one of these genes can be used to investigate its physiological effects in adult animals . Wircer et al . have now used genetic tools to investigate how orthopedia affects the ability of zebrafish to respond to social and stressful situations . It was found that zebrafish with a mutant form of otpa – but not those animals with a mutant form of otpb – display anxiety-like behavior when faced with a stressful situation . These fish also show abnormal social behavior , displaying measurably decreased tendencies to swim in a ‘social zone’ – an area next to a visible tank compartment that contains a school of zebrafish . Further investigation linked the social preferences of the fish to a particular circuit of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter oxytocin , which is known to affect social affiliation in many species . Investigation of other neurotransmitters revealed that these particular neurons also produce corticotropin-releasing hormone , which is known to regulate the response to anxiety and stress . Wircer et al . found that orthopedia regulates how much of each neurotransmitter is coproduced by the same neurons . This ability to change the balance of neurotransmitter production may allow the fish to switch between the “social” and “stress” states , enabling them to rapidly adapt to environmental changes and change their behavior . Exactly how orthopedia regulates the balance of neuropeptide production – and how this influences behavior – remains a question to be answered by further studies . More work is also needed to determine how these results relate to what occurs in the brains of mammals ."," This study looked at how changes in two genes called Otpa and Otpb affected the development of brain cells that make a chemical called oxytonin. It also examined how those changes might impact how fish respond to stressful situations and their desire to be around other fish. They found that only changing one of the genes, Otpa, caused problems with how well fish responded to stressors and their ability to want to spend time around others. To figure out why this happened, they used special techniques to look more closely at the way the brain cells developed. They discovered that when the Otpa gene was changed, some of the brain chemicals did not develop properly. When the researchers removed the group of brain nerves that made oxytons, it fixed the problem with wanting to be near other fish, but not the issue with responding to stress. Overall, this work shows that there may be ways to help animals deal better with stress by making sure certain brain chemicals develop correctly during early stages of life. However, further studies will need to be done to see if similar things happen in people as well. For example, future work could examine whether children who have issues with stress or social interactions might benefit from treatments that improve the proper development of related parts of the nervous system. In addition, since this study focused mainly on what happens after the brains are fully formed, additional experiments would be needed to determine exactly when and where Otpa plays its role in helping brain cells mature normally."
"The introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s led to large reductions in measles deaths in many countries . Yet , measles remains a major killer of children younger than age five worldwide , particularly among children living in Africa and Asia , where fewer children are immunized . India has been particularly hard hit , with annual child measles deaths exceeding 60 , 000 in 2005 . In the 1990s , India’s national vaccination program made one dose of the measles vaccine part of routine vaccinations through much of the country to help reduce the numbers of measles deaths . However , it was one of the last countries to add a second dose of measles vaccine as recommended by the World Health Organization , which has been shown to prevent infection and death in 90-95% of vaccinated children . In 2008 , the Indian government announced it would introduce a second dose of measles vaccine to its routine vaccine schedule for children from 2010 onwards . Prior to the introduction of a second-dose measles vaccine , campaigns were launched to increase immunization rates in regions where few children were being vaccinated . But how many young children’s lives were saved by these campaigns was unknown . Now , Wong et al . show that India’s measles immunization campaigns saved the lives of 41 , 000 to 56 , 000 children between 2010 and 2013 . This averted between 39-57% of the expected measles deaths nationally during that time period . Wong et al . used data from the Million Death Study , which used household surveys to capture information on the cause of 27 , 000 child deaths in India between 2005 and 2013 , to assess the affects of the state vaccination campaigns on measles deaths . Changes in measles deaths were compared to changes in unrelated child deaths to make sure any differences were related to the vaccination campaigns and not other improvements in children’s health care . Indian states with measles immunization campaigns saw larger decreases in measles deaths among children younger than five than states without such a campaign ( 27% vs 11% ) . Similar decreases were not seen in child deaths from other causes . Girls , who are disproportionately affected by measles in India , benefited from larger reductions in deaths than boys in states with immunization campaigns . The success of two-dose measles vaccination campaigns at reducing young children’s deaths in India may help to boost vaccination rates and help combat parents’ hesitance to immunize their children ."," In this study, researchers looked at how effective a measles vaccination program was in reducing measles-related deaths among Indian children under five years old. They analyzed data collected between 2 years before and 3 years after the implementation of the vaccination campaign. They found that there was a significant decrease in measles death rate in areas where the vaccinations were administered compared to those who did not receive them. Additionally, they discovered that females benefited more from these programs than males. Finally, they estimated that around 38,050 to 56,030 lives could have been saved due to this vaccination drive. Overall, their findings suggest that measles vaccine campaigns can be an important tool in reducing the number of measle-related child deaths. However, it is crucial to note that further studies are needed to fully understand the long-term effects of such campaigns and whether similar results would be observed in other countries. By continuing to investigate the effectiveness of measls vaccination programs, we can work towards eliminating measles and saving countless lives. This will require collaboration between governments, international organizations, and local communities to ensure that everyone has access to life-saving vaccines. It also requires continued investment in research to develop new and improved vaccines that provide better protection against emerging strains of the virus."
"Studies show that humans and animals replay past experiences in their brain . To do this , the brain creates a pattern of electrical activity for each part of a multistep experience and then plays them back in order . Humans and other animals can replay scenarios either while the experience is still happening ( i . e . online replay ) or later when they are resting or sleeping ( i . e . offline replay ) . Being able to replay an experience and its outcome may help a person or animal plan a better course of action in the future . However , it is poorly understood how online and offline replay each contribute to such planning . To answer this question , Eldar et al . used a brain imaging tool called magnetoencephalography ( MEG for short ) to measure the electrical activity inside the brain . This technique was able to detect replays in the brain of individuals performing a particular task , and later whilst they were resting . In the experiments , 40 healthy volunteers played a game in which each location in a space was associated with an image , for example a frog or a traffic sign , and each image was given a value . Participants got paid for moving to more valuable images in one or two steps . Eldar et al . found that people who replay their steps during a task are able to adjust their choices on the fly , whereas individuals who replay their choices during rests tend to approach a task with a less flexible , more preformed plan . Eldar et al . suggest that replaying an experience too much during rest and not enough in real-time might contribute to more rigid behaviors , a theory that could shed light on the mechanisms behind certain behavioral disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder . However , more studies are needed to determine if these two different replay strategies play a causal role in human behavior ."," This study used brain imaging technology called magnetoencaphalograpy (MEG) to investigate how our brains use past experiences to make decisions about future actions. When we encounter new situations or face difficult problems, it can be helpful to think back to similar events from the past and see what we did then. Our brains store memories of different types of events, such as where we were when we encountered them, what happened, and even how we felt about those events. By thinking about these past events, we may gain insights into how to handle current challenges. Some people tend to rely heavily on past experience to guide their behavior, whereas others prefer to explore options based on the present situation. In this study, researchers found that people who relied more on past experiences tended to engage in ""offline"" memory processing during breaks between challenging problem solving tasks. During these breaks, these individuals thought about previous versions of the same problem and imagined ways to improve upon them. On the other hand, people who focused more on the current challenge engaged in ""online"" memory recall while working on the task itself. These individuals thought back to related past experiences and considered how they might apply to the current problem. Overall, the findings suggest that both forms of memory recall play important roles in helping us plan out future actions, although they involve slightly different processes."
"Bacterial populations have traditionally been assumed to be made up of identical cells . However , while the bacteria within a population may be genetically identical , individual cells have different growth rates , metabolisms and motilities , among other things . This ‘phenotypic heterogeneity’ has been observed in many different species of bacteria , and in some cases it can be attributed to changes in the concentration of molecules called second messengers that help to relay signals from the external environment to targets within the cell . It can be challenging to monitor changes in the concentration of specific molecules inside cells , but researchers recently developed a form of microscopy based on FRET ( short for Forster resonance energy transfer ) that can measure the levels of a second messenger molecule called cyclic di-guanylate ( c-di-GMP ) inside individual cells . This technique was used to study P . aeruginosa , a bacterium that has a single corkscrew-shaped propeller that enables it to swim through liquid . P . aeruginosa divides to form two daughter cells—one with a propeller and one without . Although the daughter cell that does not have a propeller quickly grows one , FRET-based microscopy revealed that the daughter cell with a propeller had less c-di-GMP than the daughter without a propeller , but the reasons underlying this difference and its effects on bacterial behavior were not clear . Now Kulasekara et al . show that the cell that inherits the propeller contains an enzyme that degrades c-di-GMP , and that the low levels of this second messenger molecule—caused by the enzyme being concentrated near the base of the propeller , and the presence of a protein ( CheA ) that enables the bacteria to swim towards sources of nutrients—result in faster swimming speeds and increased responsiveness to nutrients . In other words , although the two daughter cells are genetically identical , they behave quite differently because of the different levels of this second messenger molecule . The existence of heterogeneity within a bacterial population likely leads to increased success and survival within changing diverse environments , and this work sets the stage for similar investigations into what establishes heterogeneity in other bacterial populations ."," Scientists have discovered that some cells in a population behave differently from each other even though they come from the same group or colony. This phenomenon is called ""individual heterogeneities"" and it can be seen when scientists use special techniques like fluorescent proteins (FRET) to measure differences inside cells. One example of these differences is something called cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-d-Gmp). Cells need c-dGmp to move around but too much of it makes them stop moving altogether. To solve this problem, bacteria have a way to get rid of extra c-D-Gmps by breaking them down into smaller pieces. These breakdowns happen at different rates depending on where they take place inside the cell. For instance, if the breakdown happens quickly enough before the next round of cell division, then there will be less c-Di-Gnps left over for the new daughter cells to deal with. However, sometimes things don't go as fast as planned and some of the daughter cells end up having more c-DI-Gnp than others. Having different amounts of cdi-gmp inside each cell allows them to swim in many different ways which helps them survive better in their environments."
"The 70 or so members of the Rab subfamily of proteins perform a wide range of important tasks inside cells . A Rab protein is always bound to another molecule , which determines whether it is inactive or active . Binding to a molecule called GDP makes the Rab protein inactive , while binding to GTP makes it active . Proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors , or GEFs for short , activate the Rab protein by promoting the release of GDP and the binding of GTP . Other proteins—known as GAPs—lead to the inactivation of the Rab protein . Together these proteins form a molecular switch that can be turned on and off . The Rab subfamily of proteins is part of the large Ras superfamily , and all members of this superfamily are activated and inactivated in a similar way , with the binding and unbinding of GDP and GTP taking place at a structure called the G-domain . The fact that the detailed structure of this domain ( at the level of individual amino acids ) has been conserved over evolution is often taken as an indication that its mechanism has also been conserved . Langemeyer et al . have now tested this assumption with four different types of GEFs—three from humans and one from the bacteria that cause Listeria—and found that the story is more complicated than expected . The experiments showed that different amino acids in the active site of the Rab protein are involved when the GEFs mediate the release of the GDP during the activation process . For example , the amino acid glutamine is involved when the Listeria GEF and one of the human GEFs activate the protein , whereas a different amino acid—aspartate—is involved when one of the other human GEFs is responsible for the activation . Using this information , Langemeyer et al . create a human Rab protein that cannot be activated by the GEF from the bacteria that cause Listeria , but can still be activated by its normal human GEF . By showing that different Rab proteins are activated by different mechanisms , and that a single Rab protein can be activated by more than one mechanism , the work of Langemeyer et al . clearly illustrates the on-going ability of evolution to surprise researchers ."," In this study, researchers investigated how different proteins activate specific types of Rab GPTases (called Rab35, Rab5, and Rab1). They found that each type of Rab requires a slightly different protein to help it get rid of its current molecule of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) before another molecule can take its place. This process is called “nucleotide replacement.” Researchers also discovered that some proteins require certain parts of the Rab molecules to work properly during nucleotides replacement. Finally, they showed that sometimes, the same Rab molecule could use two or even three different proteINS to replace its current nucleotidea. Overall, their results suggest that there are many ways to activate different kinds of Rabs, which may allow them to perform different functions within cells. However, all of these methods involve replacing the current nucleoside attached to the Rab protein with a new one. Therefore, future studies should focus on understanding why nucleotidereplacement occurs and what happens after it takes place. Understanding these processes will likely provide important insights into how Rabs control cellular activities such as vesicle trafficking and signal transduction. It may also lead to the development of new therapies targeting Rabs for treating diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease."
"Individual cells in a multicellular organism must receive signals from the environment and from other cells , and adjust their behavior accordingly . Such signals may cause a cell to grow and multiply , move , or even die . Often these signals are received by receptor proteins , which span the cell membrane and thus provide a way for signals from outside the cell to cause changes inside the cell . The tyrosine kinases are one such group of membrane receptors . When a signal binds to a tyrosine kinase , the receptor is activated and it can add chemical tags called phosphates to the part of itself , or a neighboring protein , that is inside the cell . These phosphates provide binding sites for other types of proteins , many of which contain a section called a SH2 domain . This transmits the signal and leads to further changes in the cell . However , there are over a hundred different SH2 domain-containing proteins in human cells and we do not have a clear picture of what exactly happens when receptor tyrosine kinases are activated . Jadwin , Oh et al . have now looked at how the number of SH2 domain binding sites changes over time after a signal is received . The experiments used three different experimental approaches to study a tyrosine kinase called the Epidermal Growth Factor ( EGF ) receptor , which is often over-active in human cancers . Jadwin , Oh et al . found that the timing of the changes in the number of SH2 domain binding sites on EGF varied widely . The different methods provided different perspectives on exactly when the changes happen , for example , directly observing the binding of SH2 domains to the membrane of living cells under the microscope showed that binding was much slower than expected from other methods that used purified proteins in solutions . This might be due to the receptors taking a relatively long time to form clusters at the membrane after they receive a signal . Further experiments suggested that what happens when EGF is activated may depend not only on the number of SH2 domain binding sites made , but also the timing and the physical arrangement of those sites . A long-term goal for further studies is to understand how various types of signals can lead to different outcomes in the cell ."," Scientists use different methods to study how molecules called “Src homology 5” (SH5) bind to other molecules that have certain types of chemical groups called “tyrosines.” These molecules can change shape depending on what type of signal they receive from another molecule. This process happens very quickly inside cells. By using these methods, scientists discovered new ways that some molecules could bind together faster than others. They also learned more about which kinds of molecules were most likely to interact with each other during this process. Overall, this research helps us understand better how molecule interactions happen within our bodies. It may help doctors find new treatments or cures for diseases caused by problems with these processes. For example, cancer cells might grow out of control because they do not respond properly when one kind of molecule tells another kind of nearby molecule to change its shape. If researchers learn more about how these molecules work together, it could lead to new drugs that would make cancer cells behave normally again. That’s why studying things like SH5 and tyrosines is so important! Researchers hope that learning more about them will help them figure out ways to treat illnesses like cancer. However, there is still a lot left to discover before we fully understand all the details of how these processes work inside our bodies, let alone how to fix them if something goes wrong."
"Single-celled parasites cause many severe diseases in humans and animals . The apicomplexans form probably the most successful group of these parasites and include the parasites that cause malaria . Apicomplexans infect a broad range of hosts , including humans , reptiles , birds , and insects , and often have complicated life cycles . For example , the malaria-causing parasites spread by moving from humans to female mosquitoes and then back to humans . Despite significant differences amongst apicomplexans , these single-celled parasites also share a number of features that are not seen in other living species . How and when these features arose remains unclear . It is known from previous work that apicomplexans are closely related to single-celled algae . But unlike apicomplexans , which depend on a host animal to survive , these algae live freely in their environment , often in close association with corals . Woo et al . have now sequenced the genomes of two photosynthetic algae that are thought to be close living relatives of the apicomplexans . These genomes were then compared to each other and to the genomes of other algae and apicomplexans . These comparisons reconfirmed that the two algae that were studied were close relatives of the apicomplexans . Further analyses suggested that thousands of genes were lost as an ancient free-living algae evolved into the apicomplexan ancestor , and further losses occurred as these early parasites evolved into modern species . The lost genes were typically those that are important for free-living organisms , but are either a hindrance to , or not needed in , a parasitic lifestyle . Some of the ancestor's genes , especially those that coded for the building blocks of flagella ( structures which free-living algae use to move around ) , were repurposed in ways that helped the apicomplexans to invade their hosts . Understanding this repurposing process in greater detail will help to identify key molecules in these deadly parasites that could be targeted by drug treatments . It will also offer answers to one of the most fascinating questions in evolutionary biology: how parasites have evolved from free-living organisms ."," Scientists found that some types of parasites called ""Apicomplesxa"" can be traced back to an ancient type of sea alga called ""Vitrella."" These alga live in water and get their energy by using sunlight. They also have tiny hairs called ""flagella,"" which help them move around. Over time, these alga got rid of different parts of themselves so they could survive better inside other cells instead of outside. Some of these things they got rid off became important for helping them invade other cells. For example, they used to use their flagella for swimming but now they might use them to help them invaded other cells! By studying this process over time, scientists learned more about how these kinds of parasite evolved. It's like trying to figure out where people come from - if you look at what people look like today and then go backwards in time, you can see how certain features changed and others disappeared. In this case, scientists looked at what modern parasites look like and went backwards in evolutionary history to find out when and why certain traits (like flagella) were lost or gained new functions. That way, we can learn more about where all living things came from! And who knows? Maybe one day someone will read about your family tree and try to understand where you came from too!"
"Cells called neurons connect to form large networks that process information in the brain . A region of the brain called the cerebral cortex receives information about touch from sensors in the skin . A series of neurons relay the touch information to the cerebral cortex as patterns of electrical activity called ‘spike trains’ . Understanding how these spike trains represent information about the world around us is one of the greatest challenges facing neuroscience . At first glance , the number and timing of the individual spikes within the trains appear to be random . It is possible that the irregularity within spike trains is ‘noise’ that is generated within the cortex itself . This noise could represent uncertainty about the nature of the stimulus from the sensors , or random fluctuations in brain activity . However , other findings have challenged this view and argued that these erratic spike trains actually carry hidden information . Hires et al . investigated this possibility by recording how neurons within a region of the mouse brain called the somatosensory cortex responded to sensory information coming from the mouse's whiskers . Mice sweep their whiskers across objects to locate and identify them , much like how humans feel objects with their fingertips . Here , the mice used their whiskers to judge the location of an object by touch alone , while the electrical activity of the neurons was measured using electrodes . Importantly , the movements of the whiskers and contact with the object were tracked to one millisecond precision . Similar to previous studies , sensory information from the whiskers triggered irregular spike trains in neurons within the somatosensory cortex . Hires et al . found that the apparently irregular spikes coincided precisely with the timing of when the whiskers contacted the object . Other spikes aligned perfectly with the movement of whiskers into particular positions . Furthermore , the patterns of electrical activity in the spike trains precisely predicted when and how the object was contacted , and which whisker was involved . These findings suggest that the timing of individual spikes within spike trains carries important information to the brain . Future studies will develop our understanding of how the brain interprets and responds to the rich data contained in these spike trains to identify objects and decide how to interact with them ."," Scientists have found that when animals feel something using their sense of touch, they make less noisy decisions about what happened compared to if they had not felt anything at all. This means that our brains filter out some of the noise we get from touching things so that we can better understand what's going on around us. It also suggests that there might be ways to reduce noise in other senses as well. For example, maybe we could find ways to hear more clearly underwater or see better in really bright sunlight. These findings help scientists learn how our brains process information and may lead to new ways to improve human perception. By understanding how our bodies take in information from different senses, we can figure out how to use technology to enhance those abilities. That way, even people who don’t have perfect vision or hearing could potentially gain some of these abilities back. Imagine being able to watch TV underwater without having to wear goggles! Or perhaps you could talk to someone standing outside while sitting inside on a rainy day without needing to shout. There are lots of possibilities! And this study shows that it might be possible to do these things because our brains already know how to deal with noisy signals – sometimes we just need a little extra help to “hear” them too."
"Some of the most common cancers found in children are called precursor leukemias , which may start to develop before birth . Cancerous cells often contain alterations to the genetic information in their DNA . In precursor leukemias , the most common genetic changes involve deleting , adding or rearranging segments of the DNA sequence . Several researchers have sequenced the entire DNA of childhood leukemia cells , with the result that almost all of the genetic alterations linked to these conditions have been catalogued . These efforts have shown that certain DNA regions are particularly affected by mutations , but no one knows why errors occur so frequently in these regions . Recent evidence also suggests that transcription – the process of producing useful molecules from a stretch of DNA – can play a role in generating genetic alterations . Heinäniemi et al . have now used a technique called global run-on sequencing to measure the extent of transcription in many different types of leukemia cells . This revealed that in the error-prone DNA regions , two processes – called convergent transcription and transcriptional stalling – interfere with transcription . Both processes temporarily leave the normally double-stranded DNA unzipped as two single strands and free of nucleosomes , which makes DNA more vulnerable to breaking . This would explain how pieces of DNA might be lost , added , or moved to cause the genetic errors that lead to leukemia . Further investigation revealed that two protein complexes called RAG and AID , which rearrange segments of DNA in immune cells , are likely to cause the errors in the vulnerable DNA regions . Different amounts of RAG and AID were present in different subtypes of leukemia cells , and these amounts also varied with the risk classification of the disease . Further studies are now needed to investigate the exact roles of these protein complexes . This could eventually help scientists devise strategies to protect the DNA of people with leukemia from these errors , which could reduce the risk of the cancer reoccurring ."," This study looked at how certain types of mutations called ""structural variations"" occur more often in children who have a type of cancer known as acute B cell lymbinoma leukaemia or ""pre-B ALL"". These mutations happen when parts of the DNA are deleted or copied into different places within the same gene. Previous studies have shown that these mutations tend to happen near areas where proteins called ""recombinant activator genes"" bind to the DNA. In this study, they found that many of these mutated areas also have something else in common - they are locations where the DNA is being actively used to make copies of itself. They think that because of this copying process, another protein called ""activation induced deaminise"" may be able to cause errors in the DNA sequence. They also found that some other proteins involved in making copies of DNA seem to get stuck at these mutational spots. Overall, their findings suggest that there might be ways to identify which children will develop pre-b ALL based on whether or not these particular kinds of mutants are happening in their DNA. However, further research needs to be done before we know if these methods could actually help doctors diagnose or treat pre-ALL."
"Vision is a highly complex , active process . As we observe and interact with the world around us , we constantly use eye movements to capture the visual information we need . In fact , our eyes continue to make tiny , unconscious movements even when we try to fix our gaze on something . There are two main types of tiny eye movements . The first kind , so called microsaccades , are fast , microscopic flicks that happen every second or half-second . The other kind , termed drift , is a slower , gradual motion that takes place between microsaccades , or at any time when other eye movements are not happening . However , we know far less about drifts than about any other eye movements: both the reason why they occur and the brain mechanisms controlling them are still unclear . Many scientists think that drifts are largely random movements , without any set direction . However , eye drifts do sometimes align with other behaviours – for example , they can help compensate for small , subtle head movements – suggesting that drifts may not be completely random after all . Malevich , Buonocore and Hafed therefore set out to test the hypothesis that eye drifts could , under the right circumstances , in fact be highly directed movements . These experiments used precise sensors to track eye movements in macaque monkeys , which had been trained to fix their gaze on images or shapes ( stimuli ) presented on a screen . This revealed that presenting new stimuli , even for a few thousandths of a second , could repeatedly trigger drifts . This reaction also happened quickly , starting less than one hundredth of a second after presentation of the stimulus . Further tests , using different images , revealed that the drifts were not only simply reacting to any new stimuli but also appeared to be a partially selective response to specific types of images . These tended to have larger features and less fine detail . For example , a picture of a landscape with large swaths of sky or hilltops would much more reliably trigger the eye drifts than a finely detailed checkerboard pattern , with many small squares alternating between black and white . These results suggested that drifts , far from being random movements , could be another tool for the brain to process visual information . This work sheds new light on the potential role of eye movements in vision , and adds another layer of complexity to the question of how we see . Malevich et al . hope that this study will inspire further research into the brain mechanisms behind ocular drifts ."," Scientists discovered that when people look at one spot on the screen, their eyes do not stay completely still. Instead, their eye position slowly moves over time, which scientists call ""drift."" However, these drifts are not entirely random but rather seem to be influenced by what they see. Even if something flashes briefly on the computer screen, it can cause the person's eyes to move slightly. This happens within about 1/3 second after seeing the flash. These quick shifts in eye movement happen more quickly than other types of eye movements like saccades and microsaccules. They also appear to be different from normal pupil dilation and constriction reactions. Furthermore, these fast shifts in drift may depend on how big the object is and how sharp it appears. Additionally, it seems that these quick shifts might respond differently depending on where the object appears on the display. Overall, this study shows that our eyes react rapidly to external stimuli, even though we may not notice them happening. It suggests that our unconscious brain processes may influence our eye movements without us realizing it. Further investigation into these subconscious reactions could help researchers understand better how our brains process sensory input and control our actions. By understanding these mechanisms, we could potentially develop new ways to treat neurological disorders or enhance human performance through targeted interventions."
"A single cell from a plant , an animal or another eukaryote can contain several meters of DNA . In order to fit this length inside the nucleus of the cell , the DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a compact structure known as chromatin . Chromatin exists in two forms: loosely packed chromatin tends to contain the genes that are expressed in cells , whereas highly compacted chromatin ( also called heterochromatin ) silences the expression of most nearby genes . Adding small chemical markings to histone proteins can alter how much the chromatin is compacted , and newly formed cells can inherit these markings whenever a cell divides . This enables the new cell to essentially ‘remember’ which genes were active and which were repressed in the original cell . However , no one has measured how stable heterochromatin is over multiple cell divisions; as such it is unclear if genes that should remain silent are occasionally expressed after a cell has divided a number of times . Budding yeast is a well-established model for studying heterochromatin . The genome of this single-celled organism has distinct regions of highly compacted chromatin , which are established and maintained by a number of different proteins . Dodson and Rine have developed a new technique to detect when gene silencing is lost in individual yeast cells , even if the loss of silencing only occurs for a brief period . This approach revealed that genes in supposedly ‘silent’ heterochromatin were still expressed but only very rarely—in about 1 in every 1000 cell divisions . Dodson and Rine's findings suggest that when silencing is lost , it is promptly re-established with the aid of a protein called Sir1 . In addition , the new technique revealed that Sir1 helps to prevent losses of silencing in the first place . As such , the Sir1 protein appears to have previously unappreciated roles in the maintenance and the inheritance of heterochromatin in dividing yeast cells . Dodson and Rine also discovered that a protein called Hst3—which acts to remove chemical markings from histone proteins—also helps stabilize the silenced state . With this technique in hand , it is now possible to test any molecule , environment , or cellular process for its potential effect on the stability of gene silencing ."," Scientists discovered that some genes can be turned off by being ""locked up"" inside a part of the cell called heterochrome. They wanted to know if this locking mechanism could change over time or pass from one generation to another. To answer this question, they came up with an idea to use special mutations (changes in DNA) that would allow them to see when the genes had been unlocked. By looking at many generations of yeast cells, they found out that sometimes the genes did get unlocked but very rarely. When they looked closer at how these genes got unlocked, they learned more about how the cells keep their genes locked up. Overall, they figured out new ways to study how the genes behave when they're locked up and how those locks might break. It turns out that different things happen depending on which specific type of lock breaks! So now scientists know even more about what happens inside cells and how it stays the same over time. That way, they can better understand why certain things go wrong in our bodies. Understanding these problems could help doctors find better treatments for diseases like cancer. And maybe someday, researchers will figure out other cool stuff too! Yay science! 🎢🔬📖"
"Sleep is one of the most familiar activities in our lives and yet there are still many unanswered questions related to how it is regulated . The cholinergic system ( or the part of the nervous system that sends signals using a chemical called acetylcholine ) is thought to be important for the phase of sleep that is most similar to being awake , so-called REM sleep . This collection of nerve cells has also been implicated in the process of waking up from sleep . However , it remains unclear how the cholinergic system acts on sleep . Ni , Hou et al . have now used a technique called optogenetics to use light to stimulate the cholinergic system in specific areas in the brains of mice . These experiments found that the activation of the cholinergic system caused awake mice to fall asleep , and promoted more non-REM sleep in sleeping mice . As such , this discovery challenges the previously held view that cholinergic activity was linked to waking up . Acetylcholine affects cells in a similar way to nicotine from cigarettes . In the future , Ni , Hou et al . would like to explore how many nicotine-like substances are released by the cholinergic system in specific brain areas , and to further investigate when and how sleep is promoted ."," Scientists have found that when they use light to activate certain nerve cells called cholingergic nerves, it helps make animals fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. This happens because these nerves send signals to another part of the brain called the thlmic reticular nuceus (TRN). When these nerves were activated, other nerve cells in the TRNN made them stop sending signals to wake up the animal. By doing this, the scientists could control how long the mouse stayed awake or slept. They also found out that this type of nerve cell was different than what had been studied before. Overall, their study showed that using light to turn on specific types of nerve cells can help us understand more about how our brains work during sleep. This will be helpful for future studies trying to find ways to treat people who have problems sleeping. However, there are still many questions left unanswered, such as why only some kinds of nerve signals seem to help us sleep better. Further research needs to be done to answer those questions. In conclusion, this study shows that using special lights to target specific nerve cells may hold promise for developing treatments for sleep disorders. Future studies should investigate whether similar approaches can be used to improve sleep quality in humans. More research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and implications of these findings."
"Animal lungs are filled with tiny air sacks called alveoli , where the gas exchanges that keep organisms alive can take place . Small blood vessels known as capillaries come in close contact with the alveoli , allowing oxygen to be extracted from the air into the blood , and carbon dioxide to be released from the blood into the air . The cells that line the inside of these capillaries ( known as pulmonary endothelial cells ) are important actors in these exchanges . After having been damaged , for example by viruses like influenza , the lungs need to regenerate and create new capillaries . Yet , it was still unclear how pulmonary endothelial cells participate in the healing process , and if capillaries contain several populations of endothelial cells that play different roles . To investigate this question , Niethamer et al . used an approach called single-cell analytics to examine individual endothelial cells in the alveoli of mice infected with influenza . This revealed that different subtypes of endothelial cells exist in capillaries , and that some may be able to perform slightly different jobs during lung recovery . Niethamer et al . found that all subtypes could quickly multiply after injury to create more endothelial cells and re-establish gas exchanges . However , one newly identified group ( called Car4-high ECs ) was particularly primed to receive orders from damaged alveoli . These cells were also often found at the sites where the alveoli were most injured . Lung injuries are a major cause of death worldwide . Understanding how pulmonary endothelial cells work when the organ is both healthy and injured should help to find ways to boost repair , and to create therapies that could target these cells ."," Pulmonary Endothelia Cells (PEC) are important components of the lungs responsible for exchanging oxygen between blood and airways. However, there are different types of PECs, which include macrovasculature endotelium (maEC), microvasculare endotelia (miEC), and car4-High ECs. This study used advanced technology called Single Cell Analytics to better understand these three types of ECs and how they respond during Acute Lung Injury (ALI). They found that Car4 High ECs were located near areas where tissues were being repaired after ALI. Additionally, influenza virus infection revealed a group of EC cells that rapidly divided and helped repair damaged tissues. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the roles of different types PEC play in responding to ALI and their potential as therapeutic targets for treating lung diseases. It also highlights the importance of using advanced technologies like Single Cell Analysis to better understanding complex biological processes. By doing so, researchers can gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms and develop more effective treatments. Therefore, it is crucial to invest in such technologies and continue to explore their applications in medicine and healthcare. Moreover, this research could lead to the development of personalized therapies based on patients' specific genetic makeup or other factors."
"The human body is home to many trillions of microbes; most are harmless , but some may cause disease . To live inside a host , microbes must first attach to host tissues . This process involves multiple proteins on each microbe's surface , called adhesins , which interact with the molecules that make up these tissues . Like all proteins , adhesins are long chains of simpler building blocks called amino acids , and each amino acid is connected to the next via a strong ‘covalent’ bond . Adhesins , however , typically attach bacteria to host molecules through the combined strength of many weak ‘non-covalent’ interactions . It was recently discovered that one adhesin from a bacterium called Streptococcus pyogenes contains a rare , extra covalent bond—called a thioester—in an unusual location between two of its amino acids . S . pyogenes is a common cause of throat infections in humans , and can also cause the life-threatening ‘flesh-eating disease’ . Walden , Edwards et al . have now used a range of computational , biochemical , structural biology and cell-based techniques to study other adhesins that have thioester bonds in more detail . Computational searches identified hundreds of bacterial proteins containing similar bonds . These included many from bacteria that infect humans: such as Streptococcus pneumoniae , which is the most common cause of pneumonia in adults; and Clostridium difficile , which is notorious for causing severe gut infections in hospital patients . Closer examination of the three-dimensional structures of three of these proteins—including one called SfbI from S . pyogenes—revealed that each had a clear thioester bond . Biochemical tests of an additional nine of the identified proteins strongly suggested they too contained thioester bonds . Walden , Edwards et al . then showed that SfbI was able to not only attach to tissues like conventional adhesins , but also chemically react with fibrinogen: a human protein that is essential for blood clotting and commonly found in inflamed tissues and healing wounds . This chemical reaction results in the formation of a covalent bond between SfbI and fibrinogen , which is as stable as the bonds that link the amino acids in a protein chain . Further experiments revealed that SfbI strongly binds to human cells grown in the lab under conditions that mimic tissue inflammation . Finally , Walden , Edwards et al . made a mutant version of SfbI that did not contain a thioester , and found that it could not interact with fibrinogen nor bind to human cells . Together , these findings suggest that thioesters in bacterial adhesins act like ‘chemical harpoons’ , which microbes can use to irreversibly attach themselves to molecules within their host's tissues . This attachment mechanism has not been seen before in host-microbe interactions , and further research is now needed to explore whether interfering with this process could represent a new way to treat bacterial infections ."," Scientists have discovered a way that some germs can stick to our bodies by forming strong bonds with certain chemicals found inside us called ""fibrin"". These special chemical bonds happen when a type of molecule called a ""thioester"" forms between the germs and our body's chemicals. This kind of bond is like a hook that latches onto something solid. It helps the germ stay put until it can grow and multiply. Researchers think this could be one way that germs are able to infect us and make us sick. They believe these kinds of bonds might help good germs work better too. For example, they might help doctors find ways to use good germ-like things to fight off bad ones. That would be really cool! But first scientists need to learn more about how these bonds work so they know exactly what they do and how to control them. So far, researchers don't know if all types of germs have their own unique hooks or whether there are lots of different versions out there. If they do, then maybe we will be able to come up with even better ideas for fighting off the bad guys while still letting the good ones keep helping us live healthy lives. Yay science! Science rules!!! 🤓"
"Many animals make use of chemical signals to communicate with other members of their species . Such chemical signals , called pheromones , often allow males and females of the same species to recognize each other before mating . Since the discovery of the very first pheromone in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori at the end of the 1950s , moths have been a model for pheromone research . The sex pheromone communication system in these insects has thus been well described: females emit a mixture of volatile chemicals , which can be detected by the antennae of males up to several hundred meters away . This detection is achieved through neurons with specialized proteins known as pheromone receptors that bind to the chemical signals produced by the females . Recognizing mates by detecting a very specific pheromone signature prevents moths from interbreeding with other species . The evolution of pheromone signals and their corresponding receptors can therefore lead to the rise of new reproductive barriers between populations , and eventually to the emergence of new species . The rate at which sex pheromones have diversified is likely one reason for the existence of over 160 , 000 species of moths . But how did moths’ sex pheromone receptors evolve in the first place ? Previous studies suggested that moth pheromone receptors had appeared just once during evolution . Specifically , they revealed that these receptors belong to the same branch or lineage in the ‘family tree’ of all receptors that detect chemical compounds in moths . This meant that when researchers looked for pheromone receptors in a new species of moth , they always focused on this lineage . But Bastin-Héline et al . have now found that one pheromone receptor from a pest moth called Spodoptera littoralis does not belong to this established group . First , Bastin-Héline et al . inserted this receptor into animal cells grown in the laboratory to confirm that it responds to a specific pheromone produced by S . littoralis . Next , they genetically modified moths of this species and showed that males need this receptor in order to mate . An evolutionary analysis showed that the receptor belongs to a different lineage than all the other known pheromone receptors . Together these results indicate the receptors for sex pheromones must have evolved multiple times independently in moths . These results will open new avenues for deciphering pheromone communication in moths , and lead to further research into this newly discovered lineage of candidate pheromone receptors . Such studies may foster the development of new strategies to control agricultural pests , given that some species of moths can have devastating effects on the yields of certain crops ."," Chemicals called ""pheromones"" help some animals communicate with each other. These chemicals can be used as signals to find food or mates. Scientists have found a special kind of protein that helps moth males sense when nearby females are ready to mate. They think these proteins may have been made differently than scientists thought before. This could mean that moth communication has changed more than anyone realized. It's like there were two ways to make these proteinsthe old way and the new wayand they both work well enough to let moth couples find each other most of the time. But sometimes things happen that change how the world works. Maybe there was an earthquake or a volcano eruption. Or maybe something happened long ago that we don't know about yet. Whatever it was, it might have broken or fixed part of the process so that now only one of those types of proteins will work right. Now scientists need to figure out if this is true and why it happens. If they do, then maybe they can use what they learn to help people understand their own bodies better. And maybe they'll even find a way to fix problems with these kinds of proteinthe ones that help us talk to each other or smell good smells from far away."
"Cell membranes are made of two layers of molecules called phospholipids . The types of phospholipid molecules in the outer layer are often different from those in the inner layer . This asymmetry is an important feature of most membranes , but cells also have proteins called ‘scramblases’ that can move ( or scramble ) the phospholipids between the two layers . This scrambling process often marks a cell for destruction but also plays a key role in many activities throughout the body including cell–cell fusion , blood clotting , autoimmune diseases and inflammation . Previous research revealed that a membrane protein called ANO6 is needed for some kinds of phospholipid scrambling . Other proteins that are most closely related to ANO6 are not phospholipid scramblases; instead they are channel proteins that allow ions to pass across cell membranes . ANO6 can also allow ions to flow across membranes , which raised the question: is ANO6 actually a scramblase itself , or does it control other proteins with scramblase activity ? Yu , Whitlock et al . addressed this question by engineering human cells grown in the laboratory to produce the ANO6 protein , and found that these cells had high levels of phospholipid scrambling . Next , the scrambling of phospholipids in these cells was measured while the flow of ions through ANO6 was also recorded . These experiments revealed that these two processes happened almost simultaneously . Yu , Whitlock et al . suggest that this could mean that ANO6 allows ions to leak through when it shuttles phospholipids between layers of cell membranes . ANO1 is an ion channel that is related to ANO6 but it does not have scramblase activity . By designing and testing hybrid proteins that combined parts of ANO6 and ANO1 , Yu , Whitlock et al . identified the part of ANO6 that is responsible for its scramblase activity . Furthermore , computer models of this ‘scrambling domain’ suggest that it forms an unusual groove that faces into the cell membrane , and that could help phospholipids to shuttle between the inner and outer layers of the membrane . Alternatively , this groove could interact with other proteins to regulate phospholipid scrambling; and if so , further work will be needed to identify these unknown proteins . Finally , swapping a relatively small number of features between ANO6 and ANO1 could confer scrambling activity on ANO1 . This suggests that ANO1 may itself have a special relationship to membrane phospholipids . Uncovering the nature of this relationship , if it exists , as well as understanding how ANO6 scrambles phospholipids will challenge structural biologists to generate high-resolution images of these proteins in complex with phospholipids ."," In cells, there is a common way called ""phospholpids scramling"" where certain molecules move from one side of the cell's outer layer of fatty acids to another side. This movement happens because these molecules have more energy on one side than the other. A protein called ANO 6 helps make this happen. However, it is unclear if ANO is a type of protein that lets things pass through a hole in the wall of the cells (like a channel) or if it is a different kind of protein. To figure out what ANO does, scientists used special equipment to measure both the flow of molecules across the cell walls and any electrical changes caused by ANO. They found that ANOs do both! Then they took pieces of ANO and put them into different kinds of proteins. When they did this, some proteins got the ability to help molecules cross over the cell wall. Finally, using computer programs, they made a model of what ANOs might look like. Their results suggest that ANOS might work as a kind of machine that moves molecules around inside the cell. This could explain how ANOs help molecule move across the outer layer. It also suggests that AN06 works differently than other types of ANOs."
"During development and before birth , many organs develop from branched tubes . Whether forming the airways of the lungs , the collecting ducts of the kidneys or the milk ducts of the breast , there are many similarities between these structures . Given their shared tree-like structures , one possibility is that these tissues all form through the same general process . A key challenge is understanding why branched networks develop and pattern in such a way as to assume their functional roles in the adult organ . A unifying theory , which proposes that certain tips stop growing in a random manner , has been proposed to solve this problem . In this theory , the branched mammary gland structures stop growing when the tips of the structure impinge on neighbouring branches . In the kidney , this cessation has been proposed to occur when nephrons – the structures that filter urine from blood – form near the end of the collecting ducts . By growing kidneys in the laboratory and studying developing kidneys in mice , Short et al . investigated whether nephrons do affect collecting duct growth and branch development . The results of these experiments instead suggest that nephron formation has no effect on duct growth or branching . The nephrons also do not appear to affect how quickly the duct cells grow and divide . Moreover , there is no evidence that the cell proliferation in individual branch tips ceases randomly by any other mechanism . Overall , the experiments Short et al . performed suggest that a unifying theory of branching in developing organs may not hold true , at least not in the way that has been envisioned previously ."," Scientists wanted to know if the way a baby's kidneys grow was related to how they make pee. They looked at how babies' kidneys grew and found that it wasn't linked to making urine. So, even though other parts of the body stop growing when things like blood vessels form, the kidneys keep getting bigger! This means that scientists now know more about how our bodies make kidneys!

"Some cells release molecules , such as hormones and neurotransmitters , to signal to other cells and influence how they work . As part of the release process , these molecules are packaged into small , balloon-like structures called vesicles . Such vesicles move around within cells and are able to find the right place to release their contents to the outside . A cellular compartment called the Golgi complex helps to prepare proteins for release from the cell . Vesicles can bind to tethering proteins on the surface of the Golgi , but it was not clear how these proteins are able to capture the correct kind of vesicle . The prediction was that the proteins are rigid , shaped like pipe cleaners that stick out from the Golgi as a meshwork that traps vesicles . Cheung et al . isolated a specific Golgi tethering protein ( called GCC185 ) from cultured human cells and used a technique called atomic force microscopy to visualize its structure . This revealed that this protein is not rod-like; it is instead rather floppy , and has two arms at one end that may ‘hug’ the incoming vesicle . Cheung et al . showed that this protein needs its middle portion to be floppy to work correctly . This changes the way we think about how vesicles are able to find their corresponding targets on different compartments inside cells . Further experiments are now needed to answer a number of questions . What does the tether look like when actually bound to a vesicle ? What happens after the vesicle binds – how does the tether let go ? What other components are needed for vesicle capture and release ?"," This study focuses on a type of protein called GCC 18 5, which helps deliver cargo from one place inside cells to another. It has been found that this protein needs to have some flexibility in order to do its job properly. To understand how flexible it really is, researchers used different methods such as computer modeling, proximity labeling, and atomic force spectrometry. They also looked at whether or not the beginning part of the protein was sticking out away from the rest of the structure using something called “splaying.” By doing all these things, they were able to figure out more about how this protein works and what makes it so special compared to other similar types of proteins. Overall, this study shows us that even though scientists think they know everything there is to know about certain molecules like proteins, sometimes they still surprise us! And understanding these surprises might lead to new ways to treat diseases. For example, if doctors knew exactly why a particular disease was happening in someone's body, then they could come up with better treatments for it. So, this kind of science is very important because it helps us learn more about our bodies and how to keep them healthy. Plus, who knows? Maybe someday we will be able to use these super cool technologies like atomic force spectrum microscope to look at our own proteins and see if they are behaving normally or not. That would be pretty neat!"
"Understanding complex systems , such as the weather or the spread of a pandemic , often relies on computational models that can simulate what is happening and what will happen next . Models like these can also be used to investigate biological processes . For example , cellular Potts models ( or CPMs for short ) are regularly used to simulate how cells move , self-organise to form tissues and respond to their surroundings . Computational biologists use a range of specialist skills and software to create these models . However , this can make it difficult for people who do not have programming experience to interact with these simulations and incorporate them in to their own research . If more people could engage with these models , this could help foster closer collaborations and ultimately lead to better models of biological systems . To make CPMs more accessible , Wortel and Textor created a toolbox called Artistoo that allows users to view and interact with simulations using just an internet browser . These simulations are very easy to interact with , and do not require any prior programming knowledge or specialised software . Viewers can input different parameters in to the simulation and watch in real time to see how this affects the biological system being modelled . Wortel and Textor showed that this toolbox can be used to build a range of different biological models and works just as fast as other , more complex programming tools . Artistoo has many potential applications and is a valuable education , learning , and collaboration tool . It may also encourage more open science , as having more accessible computational models could help with peer review and make it easier to collaborate across different research fields . A similar approach could be used to provide access to many other types of models in biology and beyond ."," In this study, researchers have developed a new tool called ""Artistool"" that allows them to create computer simulations of living things like cells and tissue. These simulations can help scientists better understand how these systems work by allowing them to see what happens when different conditions are applied. This tool also has other benefits such as being easy to use and accessible online without any additional software needed. Overall, this tool could be useful for studying complex biological systems and understanding how they function. It may also aid in teaching others about these topics through interactive simulations. Additionally, it could potentially lead to more collaboration between researchers from different fields who would normally not be able to communicate easily due to technical barriers. Finally, sharing results on the internet using this tool might make science more accessible to everyone around the world. However, further studies will need to be done to determine if this tool is effective in helping us learn more about our bodies and how we can keep ourselves healthy.

"Although Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder , its cause is not known and there is no cure . The symptoms of Parkinson's disease , which include tremor and slowing of voluntary movements , get progressively worse over time . The numbers of neurons in certain brain regions also decrease , causing those parts of the brain to shrink; this is known as ‘atrophy’ . However , no conclusive signs of atrophy have been found in the brains of people in the early stages of the disease . One theory suggests that Parkinson's disease is caused by a toxic protein that is able to spread from neuron to neuron . Recent advances in brain imaging have made it possible to map networks in the living human brain—the so-called brain connectome . These networks could form the ‘highways’ through which a disease-causing agent might spread . The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative ( PPMI ) is a large study that collects data from hundreds of people in an effort to identify the causes of Parkinson's disease . Zeighami et al . have now analyzed MRI scans that were collected as part of this initiative , which show the structure of the brains of 230 people in the early stages of Parkinson's disease . Comparing these scans to those from age-matched healthy individuals allowed Zeighami et al . to identify the set of brain regions that show atrophy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease . These regions correspond to a normal brain network , and the relative extent of atrophy in each brain region supports the theory that the disease spreads through the connectome . The patients who were enrolled in this study will continue to be evaluated on a yearly basis . Zeighami et al . plan to continue mapping how the disease progresses throughout the brain and to relate this to the development of new symptoms of Parkinson's disease ."," In this study, researchers used images called MRIs to look at changes in the brains of people who have Parkinson’s Disease (PD). They found that there were areas of the brain that had shrunk more than others. This included parts of the middle of the head (midbrain), which is important because it is where most of the nerve cells that cause movement problems in PD are located. Other affected areas include parts of our heads that help us move (basal ganglions) and store memories (medial temporal lobes). Researchers also looked at how much these different parts of their brains changed compared to other people without PD. They found out that the amount of change in some parts of these brains matched up with how bad symptoms were. They then compared what they saw on the scans to something else that has been done before, where scientists use special pictures taken while someone is alive but not moving or thinking anything (called fMRI). Those studies show how different parts work together when we do things like think or move around. When they did this comparison, they found that the way the brains changed in people with PD seemed to match up with the way those same parts worked together in normal brains. This means that maybe the reason why certain parts of people’s brains change is because they don’t work well anymore. It could be that the problem starts off small and slowly gets bigger over time by spreading through connections between different parts."
"The genetic information every cell needs to work properly is encoded in molecules of DNA that are much longer than the cell itself . A key challenge in biology is to understand how DNA is organized to fit inside each cell , whilst still providing access to the information that it contains . Since the way DNA is organized can influence which genes are active , rearranging DNA plays an important role in controlling how cells behave . In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria , a protein called H-NS contributes to DNA reorganization by forming or rupturing loops in the DNA in response to changes in temperature , the levels of salt and other aspects of the cell’s surroundings . In controlling loop formation , it dictates whether specific genes are switched on or off . However , it remains unclear how H-NS detects the environmental changes . To address this question , van der Valk et al . used biochemical techniques to study the activity of H-NS from E . coli under different environmental conditions . The experiments show that changes in the environment cause structural changes to H-NS , altering its ability to form DNA loops . A previously unnoticed region of the protein acts as a switch to control these structural changes , and ultimately affects which genes are active in the cell . These findings shed new light on how bacteria organize their DNA and the strategies they have developed to adapt to different environments . The new protein region identified in H-NS may also be present in similar proteins found in other organisms . In the future , this knowledge may ultimately help to develop new antibiotic drugs that target H-NS proteins in bacteria ."," Bacteria have to constantly adjust their behavior depending on what's going on around them. To do this, they change which genes get turned on or off. This process can involve something called ""global regulation"" where certain proteins help control many different genes at once. One important example of these global regulatory proteins is one called H-N-S. It helps organize the DNA inside the cell so that some parts of the DNA are more accessible than others. However, there isn't much known about exactly how H-Ns does its job or how it gets changed by things like temperature, acidity, or salt concentration outside the cell. In this study, researchers used special techniques to watch how HNS interacts with DNA under different conditions. They found that changing salt levels could cause H-ns to suddenly switch from being able to interact with DNA to not being able. Also, other molecules that H- ns might work together with either helped or hurt its ability to bind DNA. By looking at the structure of HNS using high-tech imaging tools, the scientists were able to propose a way that all these different effects might fit together. According to this idea, when salt levels go up, H- NS changes into a form that can better interact with the DNA."
"Kidneys filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine . Each kidney contains many structures called nephrons which separate the waste from the blood . The number of nephrons in a kidney varies between people , and those with low numbers have a higher risk of chronic kidney disease . Nephrons are formed before birth from a specific group of so-called progenitor cells . Each of these cells can either divide to make others like itself , or it can specialize to make nephron cells . At the end of embryonic kidney development , all the progenitor cells become nephron cells . Cells that specialize to become part of a nephron first go through a change called a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Epithelial cells move less than mesenchymal cells , and also develop a clear structure where the two ends of the cell adapt to different roles . Evidence suggests that a cell communication process called WNT/β-catenin signaling controls this transition . Yet the details of how this transition is controlled are not fully understood . One way to activate WNT/β-catenin signaling is with R-spondin proteins , which have been found in developing kidneys . Vidal et al . studied R-spondins during the embryonic development of kidneys in mice . Removing R-spondins stopped the progenitor cells from producing more of themselves and increased the number that died . The R-spondins were also needed for the progenitor cells to specialize as nephron cells through the mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Further results revealed that R-spondins activate WNT/β-catenin signaling in these cells , even though the proteins that usually act as R-spondin receptors ( called LGR4/5/6 ) could be removed without affecting the results . This suggests that R-spondins interact with different receptor proteins during kidney development . These findings highlight the role of R-spondins and WNT/β-catenin signaling in kidney development . Future studies will seek the receptor proteins that R-spondins interact with in kidneys . They may also look to understand how R-spondins balance their different roles in progenitor cells and during cell specialization . These results in mice could also be extended to determine their relevance in human health and disease , including chronic kidney disease , which is responsible for more deaths than breast or prostate cancer ."," This study shows that two proteins called RSpo1 and 3 play important roles in helping cells become what they need to be during kidneys development. Without them, cells have trouble becoming the right kind of cell at the right time. Deleting one or both genes causes problems early in life because cells don't know how to divide properly. When researchers deleted just one gene, it was enough to cause problems. However, when they deleted both genes, things got even worse. They also found out that another protein called Lgr4 helps control this process as well. But without Lgr, there were still some problems. So, while all three proteins work together to help make sure cells develop correctly, each one plays its own unique role. Overall, this study provides new insights into how certain proteins can affect the proper development of organs like the kidneys. It could lead to better ways to treat diseases caused by problems during organ development. For example, doctors might find ways to give patients missing proteins so that their bodies can grow normally again. Or maybe scientists will discover other ways to fix problems that happen during development. That would be really cool! And who knows? Maybe someday you could help make those discoveries happen. Just keep reading about science and asking questions – who knows what you might learn next?!"
"The inner surface of the vertebrate eye is lined with a multilayered structure known as the retina . The bottom layer of the retina is composed of rods and cones—neurons that are directly sensitive to light—and is called the photoreceptor layer . Rods function primarily in dim light and provide black-and-white vision , while cones support daytime vision and are responsible for colour perception . Unlike the upper layers of the retina , the photoreceptor layer does not contain blood vessels: oxygen and nutrients are instead provided by a structure just underneath the retina called the choroid . The eye relies on the rods and cones converting light into electrical signals , and the photoreceptor layer must remain free of blood vessels for this process to work properly . If blood vessels extend into the photoreceptor layer from rest of the retina ( which is above it ) or the choroid ( below ) , they can disrupt the retina and give rise to a condition called age-related macular degeneration , which is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in adults . Within the eye , the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels is stimulated by a protein known as vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) , while an inhibitor protein called sFLT-1 prevents the growth of new blood vessels in the other tissues of the eye like the cornea . However , it has not been clear what keeps the photoreceptor layer ( and also the cells that support the photoreceptor layer ) free of blood vessels , and what happens to disrupt this process of vascular demarcation in age-related macular degeneration . Now , Luo et al . reveal that cells in the photoreceptor layer produce sFLT-1 , and that the levels of this protein are indeed reduced in people with age-related macular degeneration . Using genetic and pharmacological methods , they show that a reduction in sFLT-1 triggers blood vessels to grow into the photoreceptor layer from above or below . Luo et al . also report two new genetic mouse models in which blood vessels form spontaneously in the photoreceptor layer at an early age , which should prove useful for further research into age-related macular degeneration ."," This study found that there is something called ""vascular demarking"" between the light sensitive cells at the back of our eyes (called photorectors) and the blood vessels around them. It also showed that this barrier can be broken down when certain things happen, such as a disease called age- related macular degradation (AMD). When this happens, it allows blood vessels to grow into the light-sensitive part of the eye. They then looked at how this breakdown happened and found out that one way was through a protein called VEGFA. They also found another protein, called sFlt-1, that helps keep the blood vessel away from the light sensors. They found that people who have AMD make less of this sFlT-I protein than healthy people. Finally, they tested different ways to increase the amount of sFlt-1 protein in mice and found that doing so could prevent the blood from growing into the part of their eye where the light sensor were located. Overall, these results suggest that the loss of sFtl-1 may play a role in some cases of AMD. However, more studies need to be done before we know if increasing the levels of sflt-I will actually help treat AMD."
"Most cells are programmed to maintain a certain size . This property , known as size control , is achieved by balancing growth and division , such that a cell will only divide after it reaches a certain size . However , and despite years of research , it is largely unknown how cells sense their size ( or growth ) to be able to divide accordingly . One theory proposes that there is a “sizer” protein inside cells , and that cells measure the abundance of this protein and use it to link cell size to the process of division . However , the existence of such a protein remained unproven . Li , Liu et al . have now used the cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas to identify a candidate sizer protein . Chlamydomonas cells , like many other algae , can grow to become very large mother cells that then divide one or more times in succession to produce many daughter cells . Larger mother cells undergo more divisions than smaller mother cells in order to produce daughter cells of a correct size . Using a range of genetic and biochemical techniques , Li , Liu et al . identified a protein that is produced in Chlamydomonas cells just before they begin to divide . Larger mother cells contain more of this protein than smaller cells and the protein encourages cells to divide . For example , mutant cells that lack this protein divided too few times , while cells that produce too much of it divided too many times . The protein , called CDKG1 , belongs to a family of proteins that regulate cell division in many organisms . CDKG1 is a kinase – an enzyme that alters the activity of other proteins by adding a phosphate group on to them . In Chlamydomonas , CDKG1 couples cell size to cell division by altering the activity of an important protein called the retinoblastoma-related protein that controls cell division in numerous organisms . This protein is also frequently disrupted in cancers in humans . These findings shed new light on a molecular pathway for size control . Future work will need to determine how the accumulation of CDKG1 links to the size of a mother cell and how it is inactivated once daughter cells reach the appropriate size ."," A recent study found a way to explain how some organisms can make sure they have the right size before dividing into two daughter cells. This process is called ""cell size checkpoint"" or ""sizing up"". It helps ensure that all the daughter cells made from one parent cell end up being roughly the same size. To do this, the researchers studied an alga named Chlamydamonas Reinhardtiii. They discovered a special kind of molecule called CDK1G that seems to be important for making sure the algal cells divide at the right time based on their size. When there was more of this molecule around, the algae divided earlier than normal, which resulted in smaller cells. On the other hand, when there were less of these molecules present, the cells waited longer before dividine, resulting in larger cells. These findings suggest that having different amounts of this type of molecules could help adjust the timing of cell divisions so that the final sizes of the daughter cell match those of the mothers. This discovery could lead to better understanding of how living things grow and develop. Further studies might also reveal ways to use this knowledge to improve crop yields and treat diseases like cancer. Overall, this finding provides valuable insights about how living beings maintain their proper size during growth and development processes."
"Humans are part of a group of animals called vertebrates , which are all the animals with backbones . Broadly , all vertebrates have a similar body shape with a head at one end and a left and right side that are similar to each other . Although this is not very obvious in humans , vertebrate bodies are derived from pairs of segments arranged from the head to the tail . Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development . Cells from each somite then divide , grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column , muscles , skin , and other tissues that make up each segment . Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow , but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans . Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated . Budjan et al . grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids , and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites . Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation . Once the somites formed , Budjan et al . measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used . They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes . This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time . This can provide insights into the development and evolution of humans and other animals that could then help scientists understand diseases such as the development of abnormal spinal curvature that affects around 1 in 10 , 000 newborns ."," Scientists have developed an organoid culture system that mimics early stages of human spinal cord development. They used human stem cells to grow three dimensional tissues that closely resembled what happens during human embryonic development. By optimizing conditions for growing these organoids, they were able to get them to form structures similar to those seen in developing human spines. These organoids could potentially help researchers understand how the human spine develops and how diseases affecting the spine might occur. Additionally, because these organoid systems are easy to make and reproduce, scientists may use them to test new ways to treat or prevent diseases that affect the human backbone. Overall, this work provides a useful tool for studying human spine development and potential treatments for related disorders. This research was done in the lab and did not involve any patients. Therefore, no ethical approval was needed. However, all experiments followed appropriate safety guidelines and regulations. All data generated by this project will be shared publicly once published. This means that other scientists around the world will be able to access the results and use them in future studies. This helps promote open science and allows researchers to build on each other's work to advance our understanding of human health and disease. Overall this research represents an important step forward in our ability to study human spiral ganglion neuron development and could lead to new insights about hearing loss and other inner ear disorders."
"People with various forms paralysis not only have difficulties getting around , but also are less able to use many communication technologies including computers . In particular , strokes , neurological injuries , or diseases such as ALS can lead to severe paralysis and make it very difficult to communicate . In rare instances , these disorders can result in a condition called locked-in syndrome , in which the affected person is aware but completely unable to move or speak . Several researchers are looking to help people with severe paralysis to communicate again , via a system called a brain-computer interface . These devices record activity in the brain either from the surface of the scalp or directly using a sensor that is surgically implanted . Computers then interpret this activity via algorithms to generate signals that can control various tools , including robotic limbs , powered wheelchairs or computer cursors . Such tools would be invaluable for many people with paralysis . Pandarinath , Nuyujukian et al . set out to study the performance of an implanted brain-computer interface in three people with varying forms of paralysis and focused specifically on a typing task . Each participant used a brain-computer interface known as “BrainGate” to move a cursor on a computer screen displaying the letters of the alphabet . The participants were asked to “point and click” on letters – similar to using a normal computer mouse – to type specific sentences , and their typing rate in words per minute was measured . With recently developed computer algorithms , the participants typed faster using the brain-computer interface than anyone with paralysis has ever managed before . Indeed , the highest performing participant could , on average , type nearly 8 words per minute . The next steps are to adapt the system so that brain-computer interfaces can control commercial computers , phones and tablets . These devices are widely available , and would allow paralyzed users to take advantage of a range of applications that can be easily downloaded and customized . This development might enable brain-computer interfaces to not only allow people with neurological disorders to communicate , but also assist other people with paralysis in a number of ways ."," In this study, researchers created a computer program that can read thoughts from the brains of people who cannot move their bodies or speak. They used this program to help three patients communicate via computers. These patients were able to use the program to type messages at rates much higher than those achieved in other similar experiments. This shows that these types of programs could be very useful tools for helping people with severe disabilities communicate. The full details of how the program works can be found in the article. However, it should be noted that while this technology has great promise, more work needs to be done before it can be widely used outside of a laboratory setting. Overall, this study represents an important step forward in our ability to understand and harness the power of the human brain. By continuing to develop technologies like this one, we may be able to better assist people with disabilities and improve their quality of life. It will take time and effort to make sure that these technologies are safe, effective, and easy to use. But if we keep working hard, I think we'll find even more amazing ways to unlock the secrets of the brain and use them to benefit everyone. So stay tuned because there's no doubt that more exciting discoveries are on the way! Scientists have made a special tool that lets people send messages just by thinking. They tried it out on three people who couldn't move or talk. Those people were able"
"Hunting is an innate behaviour that relies on predators executing a precise set of actions to identify , approach , target , and strike prey . In vertebrates ( animals with a backbone ) , the identity of the brain circuits that trigger hunting is still unclear . These networks are thought to link sensory perception ( seeing prey ) with a specialised action ( starting an attack ) . Larval zebrafish are a good model in which to study these circuits , because they have a tiny , transparent brain where neurons can be observed in real time . In addition , it is expected that the networks that control hunting in this species will be preserved across other vertebrates . To discover these networks , Antinucci et al . genetically engineered zebrafish larvae so that their brain cells would ‘glow’ when they became active . This revealed which individual brain cells would turn on when zebrafish started to hunt . These neurons were in a part of the brain called the pretectum , which receives visual information about prey from the eye . Next , Antinucci et al . harnessed a technique called optogenetics to artificially turn on these brain cells in the pretectum , which caused the fish to start hunting even when prey was absent . In fact , stimulating just one pretectal cell was enough to trigger the behaviour . Conversely , killing pretectal brain cells using precise laser surgery hindered hunting in zebrafish exposed to prey . These experiments suggest that pretectal brain cells act like a command centre that controls hunting . They likely play a decision-making role , determining when animals do and do not respond to events in their surroundings . Similar neurons likely control other types of behaviour . Understanding how these circuits work at the cellular level in zebrafish may help scientist study them in other organisms , such as humans ."," Hunting behavior is important for most living creatures because it helps them survive. However, scientists do not know how hunting behaviors are controlled. In order to study this question, researchers looked at fish called zebra fish. They found a part of the brain that becomes very active right before the fish starts to hunt. This area of the fish's brain also has some special kinds of cells that seem to be involved in controlling hunting behavior. When they turned on these cells using light, the fish started to perform all the actions needed to catch food even without any food present! If they turn off these cells, then the fish will no longer do their hunting movements. Scientists think that these cells act like a ""switch"" that turns on hunting mode. These findings could help us understand more about why people sometimes feel like doing certain things, such as eating. It might also teach us ways to change our own behavior if we don't like how we are feeling or acting. For example, maybe there is a way to make ourselves feel happier or calmer just by thinking about certain parts of our brains. Or perhaps there is something we can do to activate those areas so that we start behaving differently. That would be really helpful! But first, scientists need to learn much more about how different parts of the human brain work together to make us feel and behave the way we do."
"Biomedical scientists have invested significant effort into making it easy to perform lots of experiments quickly and cheaply . These “high throughput” methods are the workhorses of modern “systems biology” efforts . However , we simply cannot perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type , genetic mutation and other conditions . In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets , or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored . But which experiments should we pick ? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately , the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be , or a combination of the two ? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time . However , computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments , and machine learning algorithms allow computers to “learn” how to make predictions and decisions based on the data they’ve previously processed . Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed “active learning” could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done . Now , Naik et al . have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope . The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you can’t predict ( or that you predicted incorrectly ) than from just confirming your confident predictions . The results of the robot-driven experiments showed that the active learning approach outperforms strategies a human might use , even when the potential outcomes of individual experiments are not known beforehand . The next challenge is to apply these methods to reduce the cost of achieving the goals of large projects , such as The Cancer Genome Atlas ."," Scientists want to know how chemicals affect cells by looking at where certain molecules inside the cell go. To do this, they need to test lots of different chemicals and see what happens. They also want to find out if these chemicals will have any effect on other kinds of molecules. Normally, scientists would make predictions about how each chemical affects every single kind of molecule separately. But sometimes it’s hard to predict how some chemicals might work together with others. So, researchers from MIT developed a way to use computers to help them figure out which combinations of chemicals to test. This method helped them discover how 47 different chemicals affected 46 different types of moleculess using just 30% of the total number of tests needed! By testing fewer combinations than they otherwise would have, the researchers were able to save time and money. Plus, their new approach was able to successfully predict how the same chemicals might affect other kinds molecules too. Overall, this study shows that computer methods like active learning can help scientists design better experiments faster and cheaper. In the future, this method could even lead to developing new drugs or treatments for diseases. For example, doctors could one day run blood samples from patients through this type of program to quickly identify potential drug candidates that could treat specific medical conditions."
"When a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell , this creates a single-celled embryo called a zygote that will go on to divide repeatedly throughout development . The zygote inherits the contents of the egg including many important proteins that initially control how the embryo develops . In mice , the embryo takes over control of development once the zygote has divided to form a two-celled embryo . This transition of control destroys the maternally inherited proteins and selectively activates zygotic genes and some DNA sequences called transposable elements that evolved from virus DNA . One of the proteins inherited from the egg cell is called Stella . Embryos that lack Stella die within the first few cell divisions , which suggests that the protein is needed during the earliest stages of development . However , it is not clear what Stella's role in the early embryo is . Huang , Kim et al . decided to investigate how Stella might affect the genes that are switched on during development by using a technique called RNA-seq to study egg cells and early embryos from mice . Two-celled embryos that lacked Stella could not activate a number of genes that produce proteins that are critical for development . They also failed to activate a group of transposable elements called endogenous retroviruses . In particular , a lack of Stella significantly reduced the activity of an endogenous retrovirus called MuERV-L . Further experiments showed that MuERV-L is needed for normal embryonic development , and so suggests that transposable elements play important roles in this process . Future studies will aim to explore these roles in more detail . It will also be important to identify the genes that Stella targets in embryos , and to investigate the roles that similar maternally inherited proteins play in early embryonic development ."," This study investigates how genes work together to help an egg develop into an embryon. Specifically, it looks at one particular gene called ""Stella"" that helps activate other genes once the egg has been fertilized. Without Stella, many genes don't get turned on properly, leading to problems with the developing embryons. These problems include something called ""maternal-zygote transition,"" where the egg stops relying on its own genetic material and starts relying more on new genetic material from the sperm. In addition, without Stella some types of viruses that live inside cells (called endogenious retrovirsues) didn't become active. When these viruses aren't active, the embroyos have trouble growing normally. Overall, this study shows that Stellla plays an important role in helping eggs grow into healthy embryones. It also suggests that certain viruses might be helpful for normal growth as well. However, more studies need to be done before we know exactly how much they contribute. Future research could lead to better ways to make sure eggs can grow into strong embryes. For example, scientists could find out if adding certain chemicals to IVF media would help keep these virus active so that embryoes would grow stronger."
"An animal that finds particularly nutritious and palatable food will often develop a long-lasting memory—even if they experience that event only once . One example of this is the ability of the fruit fly Drosophila to form a long-term association between a sugar reward and a specific odor that was present when they received the reward . The consumption of sugar triggers the release of a chemical called dopamine on specific compartments of a brain structure called the mushroom body . Dopamine then acts to modify the connection between cells called “Kenyon cells” , which encode specific odors , and the neurons that send signals out from the mushroom body ( called MBONs ) . The result is the formation of a memory that links the odor with the reward . However , little is known about how this process differs for long-term vs . short-term memories , and how it can occur when the fly has experienced the odor and reward together on only a single occasion . To find out , Ichinose et al . combined behavioral testing of fruit flies with genetics . The results confirmed that the dopamine neurons and the MBONs that project to a single compartment of the mushroom body , called α1 , are both required for the formation of long-term odor-reward memories , but not their short-term equivalents . These neurons are called PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 , respectively . Unexpectedly , anatomical data revealed that PAM-α1 dopamine neurons receive input from MBON-α1; that is , long-term memory formation involves a feedback circuit: from PAM-α1 to Kenyon cells , then to MBON-α1 and back to PAM-α1 . Blocking feedback from the MBON-α1 onto the PAM-α1 neurons shortly after odor-reward training disrupted long-term memory formation . Conversely , blocking feedback at a later stage did not . This suggests that prolonged activation of PAM-α1 by MBON-α1 helps to strengthen newly established memories , converting them into memories that will last for a long time . The discovery of a specific circuit that supports long-term , but not short-term , memory formation in fruit flies is consistent with evidence of distinct mechanisms underlying these processes in mammals . Further work is now required to determine whether feedback circuits similar to those in fruit flies also contribute to reward-based learning in other animals ."," Dopamine neuron activity can be triggered by rewards such as food or water. When fruit flies experience something new, like tasting a sweet liquid, certain types of dopaminergic neurons become active. These neurons help form a short-term taste memory so that the fly remembers what it has already experienced. However, if the fly experiences a really good reward, these neurons also trigger another kind of memory called long- term memory (LTM). To make an LTM, the brain needs to store information about the reward in multiple places. Scientists have found out how one particular pair of cells helps to store LTMs in the right place in the brain. They discovered that when a fly tastes something sweet, some kinds of dopaminergic neuron get activated. Those neurons then send messages to other parts of the brain where they activate special cells called MBONs. The MBON cells keep the message going even after the initial activation of the dopamingerigc neurons stops. Because of this relay system, the fly will remember that it has had a good experience and will seek out more of whatever was sweet enough to give them a strong dopamine response. While this process works well most of the time, there is a tradeoff between being able to distinguish different flavors and remembering what is worth coming back to."
"Malaria is a significant health concern , killing about 400 , 000 people each year . While antimalarial drugs and insecticides have successfully reduced deaths over the last 20 years , the parasite that causes malaria is starting to gain resistance to these treatments . Vaccines offer an alternative route to preventing the disease . However , the most advanced vaccine currently available provides less than 50% protection . Vaccines work by encouraging the body to develop proteins called antibodies , which can recognize the parasite and trigger an immune response that blocks the infection . These antibodies target a molecule on the parasite’s surface called circumsporozoite protein , or CSP for short . Therefore , having a better understanding of how antibodies interact with CSP could help researchers design more effective treatments . A lot of what is known about malaria has come from studying this disease in mice . However , it remained unclear whether antibodies produced in rodents combat the malaria-causing parasite in a similar manner to human antibodies . To answer this question , Kucharska , Thai et al . studied a mouse antibody called 3D11 , which targets CSP on the surface of a parasite that causes malaria in rodents . The interaction between CSP and 3D11 was studied using three different techniques in order to better understand how the structure of CSP changes when bound by antibodies . The experiments showed that although CSP has a highly flexible structure , it forms a more stable , spiral-like architecture when bound to multiple copies of 3D11 . A similar type of assembly was previously observed in studies investigating how CSP interacts with human antibodies . Further investigation revealed that the molecular connections between 3D11 and CSP share a lot of similarities with how human antibodies recognize CSP . These findings reveal how mammals evolved similar mechanisms for detecting and inhibiting malaria-causing parasites . This highlights the robust features antibodies need to launch an immune response against malaria , which could help develop a more effective vaccine ."," Scientists used different techniques to study how well a specific type of antibodies binds to proteins found on the surface of parasites called sporzoites. These proteins are called circumsporeozoietein or ""CSP"" for short. Sporozioites are responsible for spreading diseases like malaria from person to person. Some types of antibiotics work by attaching themselves to these proteins so they cannot do their job properly. In order to make better vaccines, scientists need to understand more about how these antibodities work. To do this, they studied one particular kind of antibiotic called 3d11 and looked at how it works when it's attached to different versions of CPS from different kinds of parasitse. They used computer modeling, x-ray technology, and electron microscopy to figure out exactly where and how the antibody binds and what happens after it does. This will help researchers learn more about why some antibioties don't work as well as others and how to make them stronger. It could also lead to new ways of fighting off diseases caused by parasites. For example, if you know how certain antibiotys attach to CSP, then maybe you can design medicines that block those attachment sites so the antibioty can't do its job right."
"Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent severe COVID-19 . Two doses of mRNA vaccine protect against serious illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 . They do this , in part , by encouraging the immune system to make specialised proteins known as antibodies that recognise the virus . Most of the vaccine research so far has focussed on these antibodies , but they are only one part of the immune response . Vaccines also activate immune cells called T cells . These cells have two main roles , coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected with viruses . It is likely that they play a key role in preventing severe COVID-19 . There are many kinds of T cells , each with a different role . Currently , the identity and characteristics of the T cells that protect against COVID-19 is unclear . Different types of T cells have unique proteins on their surface . Examining these proteins can reveal details about how the T cells work , which part of the virus they recognise , and which part of the body they protect . A tool called cytometry by time of flight allows researchers to measure these proteins , one cell at a time . Using this technique , Neidleman , Luo et al . investigated T cells from 11 people before vaccination and after their first and second doses . Five people had never had COVID-19 before , and six had already recovered from COVID-19 . Neidleman , Luo et al . found that the T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the two groups differed . In people who had never had COVID-19 before , the second dose of vaccine improved the quality and quantity of the T cells . The same was not true for people who had already recovered from COVID-19 . However , although their T cells did not improve further after a second vaccine dose , they did show signs that they might offer more protection overall . The proteins on the cells suggest that they might last longer , and that they might specifically protect the nose , throat and lungs . Neidleman , Luo et al . also found that , for both groups , T cells activated by vaccination responded in the same way to different variants of the virus . This work highlights the importance of getting both vaccine doses for people who have never had COVID-19 . It also suggests that vaccination in people who have had COVID-19 may generate better T cells . Larger studies could show whether these patterns remain true across the wider population . If so , it is possible that delivering vaccines to the nose or throat could boost immunity by mimicking natural infection . This might encourage T cells to make the surface proteins that allow them to home to these areas ."," This study looked at how well memory T cells made by different people's bodies react to different versions (variants) of the coronavirus that causes COVID- 19. They used a type of test called flow cytometry to measure how many memory T cell were found in each person's body, as well as what kind of memory T-cell was being produced. They also tested how good these memory T lymphocytes would be at fighting off the virus if they came into contact with it again. To do this, they took blood samples from three groups of people: those who had never been infected with COVID- before getting two shots of the vaccine; those who already had COVID- once and then got two shots; and those who only got one shot of the J&J vaccine. All three groups were followed over time to see how their memory T -cells changed after getting the vaccine. Overall, the researchers found that all types of memory CD8+ T cells generated by either natural infection or vaccination recognized all variants equally well. However, there were some differences between the two groups. For example, people who had previously been infected showed stronger responses than those who hadn’t. Also, the way the memory T –cells behaved was slightly different between the groups. Specifically, the memory CD4+ T- cells from people who were naturally infected seemed to be better able to fight off the disease again and were more likely to go back to where the virus attacks the body most often."
"Genes with the potential to cause tumors and cancer are commonly called oncogenes . One example of an oncogene encodes for a protein called MYC and many tumors contain high levels of this protein . MYC is a transcription factor and studies of aggressive tumors suggested that , like most other transcription factors , MYC binds to and regulates the activity of a small number of genes in tumors . However , other studies went on to show that MYC actually binds to thousands of genes and somehow only regulates a subset of them during tumor development . Lorenzin et al . set out to understand how this process works by generating human cells in which the concentration of MYC protein could be altered . In the experiments , the concentration was varied from normal healthy levels to the high levels found in aggressive tumors . The amount of MYC bound to genes and the extent to which it activated the genes inside these cells was also measured . Lorenzin et al . found that increasing MYC levels from normal to tumor-specific levels did not affect MYC binding at genes where the transcription factor was already strongly bound in normal cells . Rather , MYC binding increased only at genes that were weakly bound in normal cells . Consistent with this observation , only genes at which MYC was weakly bound in normal cells were activated by increasing MYC levels . This observation suggests that increasing the concentration of MYC protein from normal to tumor-specific levels “fills up” previously empty binding sites around these genes with the transcription factor . Lorenzin et al . also used mathematical modeling to understand how the concentrations of MYC in normal and tumor cells might explain how MYC behaves in cells . Together , the results imply that the MYC transcription factor regulates distinct sets of genes in normal and tumor cells according to how much MYC is present . Further studies may show that the altered regulation of a tumor-specific set of genes is important for tumor development and could use this new information to identify new targets for treating MYC-driven tumors ."," This study looked into how certain genes respond differently when exposed to higher or lower amounts of a protein called MYC. Previous studies had suggested two possible ways that MY could work: either it affects every single gene in the same way (like turning up the volume on a radio), or each gene responds differently depending on how much MYC there is. To test this idea, researchers measured how many copies of MY were being made in the cell, then compared which genes were turned on under these conditions. They also examined which genes had more MYC ""stuck"" to them using special techniques. By looking at both sets of data together, they found that some genes only turn on if there's enough MYC around, suggesting that those genes need lots of MY to get going. Other genes seem to be able to turn on even with low amounts of MY, but still perform better when there' s more MY available. These findings help us understand how having too much MY can cause cancer, because it shows how MY can affect different kinds of genes in very specific ways. It might be helpful to think about this like a game where you have limited pieces - some games require more pieces to play well, whereas others will let you win even with just a few pieces. In the same sense, some genes need more MY than others to do their job properly, whereas other genes can manage with less."
"In Canada , tuberculosis disproportionately affects the Inuit , a group of indigenous people inhabiting the Arctic regions . Canada is aiming to eliminate tuberculosis among the Inuit by 2030 . One way to help stop transmission and prevent future outbreaks is to trace how and where the disease spreads using DNA sequencing . This information can then be used by public health organizations to identify possible interventions . Typically , the DNA of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis – Mycobacterium tuberculosis , or Mtb for short – is sequenced 50–100 times and a consensus DNA sequence is then generated for each patient from this data . These consensus DNA sequences are then compared to help piece together who infected whom . Recently , scientists have realized that the bacteria a person is infected with may have different DNA sequences due to people being infected with more than one bacterium or the bacterium developing variations in its genome after the infection . However , current DNA sequencing practices may miss these differences , making it harder to trace how the disease spreads . Now , Lee et al . show that sequencing the DNA of Mtb from an infected person 500–1000 times ( i . e . ∼10-20 times more than usual ) makes it easier to detect genetic differences and determine how tuberculosis spreads . This approach , also known as ‘deep sequencing’ , was used to analyze DNA samples of Mtb collected from about 50 people during an outbreak of tuberculosis in 2011-2012 , which had previously undergone standard DNA sequencing . This deep sequencing approach identified a ‘super-spreading event’ where one person had likely transmitted tuberculosis to up to 17 others during the outbreak . Lee et al . found that most of these people had visited the same ‘gathering houses’ which are social venues in the community . Implementing targeted public health interventions at these sites may help stop future outbreaks . To fully understand how useful this method will be for tracking the spread of tuberculosis , deep and routine sequencing will need to be compared against each other in different settings and outbreaks . Furthermore , the approach used in this study may be useful for tracking the transmission of other infectious diseases ."," A recent study used advanced technology called ""deep"" DNA sequencing to look at how a type of bacteria called Mycrobacterium spreads among people living in Canada's North. They found that one person was able to infect many others, which is known as ""super spreading."" By looking closely at the genetic makeup of the bacteria, they could tell that this person had infected about half of those who got sick during an outbreak. Using this method, researchers might be better able to find out when someone is responsible for spreading disease to many others. This could help them stop outbreaks faster. This technique could also be useful for studying how other diseases spread. For example, scientists could use it to figure out if certain people are especially good or bad at spreading viruses like COVID-19. That would be really helpful because knowing who these ""superspreaders"" are could help doctors come up with ways to keep the virus from spreading around. Overall, this new way of doing science is pretty cool! It lets us learn even more about things than we already knew, just by using better tools. And that means we get closer to finding cures for stuff like cancer, HIV, and Alzheimer's disease. Yay science! 🔬"
"Our bodies are home to lots of microorganisms , many of which are found throughout the gut . Gut microbes play important roles in human health , where they cooperate with our own cells to develop the immune system , synthesize essential vitamins , and help to absorb nutrients . When the cooperation between our own cells and the gut microbes fails , the microbial community within the gut can become a source of infection , sometimes leading to life-threatening diseases . Healthy individuals typically have many different types gut microbes , whereas people with poor health , or older individuals , will often have less diverse and a higher percentage of disease-causing microbes . For example , African turquoise killifish only live a few months , during which the composition of their gut microbes undergoes dramatic changes . While young fish harbor highly diverse microbial communities , older fish have less diverse communities and more microbes associated with disease . Until now , it was not known whether manipulating the gut composition could affect the aging process . By using the killifish as a model for their study , Smith et al . revealed that gut microbes affect how the fish survived and aged . When the guts of middle-aged fish were colonized with microbes transferred from younger fish , the older fish lived longer and were more active later in life . These fish also maintained a more diverse microbial community throughout their adulthood and shared key microbes with young fish – possibly associated with the improved health benefits . These results suggest that controlling the composition of the gut microbes can improve health and increase life span . The model system used in this study could provide new ways to manipulate the gut microbial community and gain key insights into how the gut microbes affect aging . Manipulating gut microbes to resemble a community found in young individuals could be a strategy to delay the onset of age-related diseases ."," Scientists have found that the type of bacteria living inside an animal's body can affect how long it lives. They used fish as an example because some types of these fish only live for about 6 months. By putting certain kinds of bacteria into the guts of older fish, they were able to make them live longer and stay healthy for longer too. These special bacteria helped keep the fish's bodies cleaner and healthier so they could live longer. This shows us that having good bacteria in our bodies might help us live longer! It also means scientists now know where to look if they want to find ways to help people live longer too! In fact, this study showed that the kind of bacteria that helps fish live longer are very different than the ones that usually help humans live longer, which is really cool! Now scientists will be able to learn more about both animals and people by studying what makes these two groups of bacteria so different. That way, maybe one day we can use science to help both animals AND people live even longer! Yay! Science is awesome!!! 🤩🧬🐒🦁📚🔍👨‍🎓🌊🗺"
"Living cells have a surrounding membrane that largely insulates the space inside from that outside . Yet signals from outside of the cell can still influence how that cell behaves . One way this can happen is via small molecules called ligands binding to proteins embedded in the membrane and triggering a cascade of reactions inside the cell . Studying this kind of protein-ligand interaction is important for many aspects of biology . However , such studies typically require that the ligand be first labeled in some way , which is time-consuming , costly and may alter how the ligand behaves . As such , there is a need for alternative ways to measure ligands binding to proteins in membranes . The fact that the two sides of a membrane are insulated from each other means that they can store electrical charges . The ability to store charges is called capacitance . Theory predicts that it should be possible to detect a change in capacitance when a ligand binds to a membrane protein . Yet , though the theoretical basis of this hypothesis has been widely accepted , it had not been tested experimentally until now . Burtscher et al . chose to focus on a membrane protein called the serotonin transporter because a large number of its ligands had already been characterized . Experiments with human cells that expressed this transporter confirmed that the binding of a ligand was indeed detectable as a change in membrane capacitance . Burtscher et al . also detected a brief electrical current across the membrane that is predicted to occur when the capacitance changes . Ligand binding studies are especially important in therapeutics , as many drugs rely on blocking specific signaling pathways in diseased cells . As these capacitance recordings show precise real-time measurements , they could be used for drug screening in the future , all without the need to label the ligands ."," In this study, researchers used electrophysiology techniques to monitor how different substances bind to a certain kind of protein called the seratonin transporters (SERT). They found that when they applied specific chemicals to block SERT, it caused an electrical signal that could be detected quickly. By analyzing this signal, they were able to determine whether the chemical was directly interacting with the protein or causing another kind of reaction. Their findings suggest that this method could potentially be used to measure how other kinds of chemicals affect the function of SERT. Overall, their results show that electrophysical methods can provide detailed information about how cells respond to various stimuli at very fast timescales. This knowledge may help scientists better understand how drugs work inside our bodies and develop new treatments for diseases. However, more studies need to be done before applying this technology to human patients. For example, further experiments should test if similar signals occur when SERT interacts with other types of molecules like viruses or bacteria. If so, then this method might also have applications in diagnosing infectious diseases or identifying potential drug targets. Additionally, future research could explore ways to use this technique to screen large numbers of compounds for their ability to modulate SERT activity. Such advances would greatly expand the utility of electrophysics as a tool for studying biological systems and developing new therapies."
"Our brains contain billions of neurons , which are continually producing electrical signals to relay information around the brain . Yet most of our knowledge of how the brain works comes from studying the activity of one neuron at a time . Recently , studies of multiple neurons have shown that they tend to be active together in short bursts called “up” states , which are followed by periods in which they are less active called “down” states . When we are sleeping or under a general anesthetic , the neurons may be completely silent during down states , but when we are awake the difference in activity between the two states is usually less extreme . However , it is still not clear how the neurons generate these patterns of activity . To address this question , Stringer et al . studied the activity of neurons in the brains of awake and anesthetized rats , mice and gerbils . The experiments recorded electrical activity from many neurons at the same time and found a wide range of different activity patterns . A computational model based on these data suggests that differences in the degree to which some neurons suppress the activity of other neurons may account for this variety . Increasing the strength of these inhibitory signals in the model decreased the fluctuations in electrical activity across entire areas of the brain . Further analysis of the experimental data supported the model’s predictions by showing that inhibitory neurons – which act to reduce electrical activity in other neurons – were more active when there were fewer fluctuations in activity across the brain . The next step following on from this work would be to develop ways to build computer models that can mimic the activity of many more neurons at the same time . The models could then be used to interpret the electrical activity produced by many different kinds of neuron . This will enable researchers to test more sophisticated hypotheses about how the brain works ."," Scientists have found that when many brain cells work together, they sometimes behave like one big cell. This happens because each individual cell has its own natural tendency to be either ""active"" or ""quiet."" When all the cells do their thing at once, it creates a kind of group activity called a ""fluctuation."" Sometimes, these fluctuatiosn happen even if there's no outside signal coming into the brain. These kinds of fluctutations are called ""intrinsic fluctuations,"" and they seem to come from inside the brain itself. But scientists don't know exactly how these intrinsic fluctuations affect what we sense or feel. So, researchers used computer simulations to figure out how these internal fluctuations might work. They started by looking at data from real brains, where groups of cells were recorded while animals were doing different things. Then, using this data, they built a computer program that could simulate how these cells would act on their own. By running these simulations over and over again, the scientists discovered that some types of cells (like those that make dopamine) seemed to help keep the other cells quieter than normal. In contrast, other types of neurons (those that make serotonin) made the other neurons go wild. It turned out that whether these chemicals helped calm down the other brain cells or made them jumpier depended on which type of activity was going on in the brain at the time. For example, when rats were sleeping, the dopaminergic neurons tended to be quiet, so the other types stayed quiet too. On the other hand, when the rats woke up and started moving around, the serotonergic neuron got louder, causing the rest of the neurons to get louder as well. Based on these findings, the authors think that the balance between these two types of chemical signals helps determine how much intrinsic fluctuation occurs in the nervous system."
"Ageing happens to us all , and as the cabaret singer Maurice Chevalier pointed out , ""old age is not that bad when you consider the alternative"" . Yet , the growing ageing population of most developed countries presents challenges to healthcare systems and government finances . For many older people , long periods of ill health are part of the end of life , and so a better understanding of ageing could offer the opportunity to prolong healthy living into old age . Ageing is complex and takes a long time to study – a lifetime in fact . This makes it difficult to discern its causes , among the countless possibilities based on an individual’s genes , behaviour or environment . While thousands of regions in an individual’s genetic makeup are known to influence their risk of different diseases , those that affect how long they will live have proved harder to disentangle . Timmers et al . sought to pinpoint such regions , and then use this information to predict , based on their DNA , whether someone had a better or worse chance of living longer than average . The DNA of over 500 , 000 people was read to reveal the specific ‘genetic fingerprints’ of each participant . Then , after asking each of the participants how long both of their parents had lived , Timmers et al . pinpointed 12 DNA regions that affect lifespan . Five of these regions were new and had not been linked to lifespan before . Across the twelve as a whole several were known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease , smoking-related cancer or heart disease . Looking at the entire genome , Timmers et al . could then predict a lifespan score for each individual , and when they sorted participants into ten groups based on these scores they found that top group lived five years longer than the bottom , on average . Many factors beside genetics influence how long a person will live and our lifespan cannot be read from our DNA alone . Nevertheless , Timmers et al . had hoped to narrow down their search and discover specific genes that directly influence how quickly people age , beyond diseases . If such genes exist , their effects were too small to be detected in this study . The next step will be to expand the study to include more participants , which will hopefully pinpoint further genomic regions and help disentangle the biology of ageing and disease ."," Scientists used data from over one million people who had their DNA tested to study what genes might be linked to how long we live. They found several new links between certain genes and our lifespace. These included genes related to blood type, protein production, and brain development. They also looked at whether specific genes were more likely to cause us to die earlier due to things like Alzheimer’s or heart disease. Some genes seemed to make it less likely that you would get these diseases, so they could help you live longer. Overall, this study showed that many different parts of your body work together to affect how long you will live. It also suggested that knowing about some of these genes could help doctors figure out if someone was likely to live a very short or very long time based just on their genes. However, there are still lots of ways that being sick or having bad habits can affect how quickly you die even when you have good genes. So while learning more about these genes may help us understand why some people live shorter lives than others, it won’t change everything. For example, eating healthy foods and exercising regularly can still help keep you healthier no matter what your genes look like! In addition, the researchers did not find any way to tell exactly how much each individual gene affected how long a person lived. That means that although they know some of the important genes involved in making sure we don’t live too long or too short, they haven’t figured out yet how those genes actually do their job."
"The immune system uses antibodies to fight microbes that cause disease . White blood cells pump antibodies into the bloodstream , and these antibodies latch onto bacteria and viruses , targeting them for destruction . But sometimes , the immune system gets it wrong . In autoimmune diseases , white blood cells mistakenly make antibodies that target the body's own tissues . Detecting these 'autoantibodies' in the blood can help doctors to diagnose autoimmune diseases . But the identities and targets of many autoantibodies remain unknown . In one rare disease , called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS-1 ) , a faulty gene makes the immune system much more likely to make autoantibodies . People with this disease can develop an autoimmune response against many different healthy organs . Although APS-1 is rare , some of the autoantibodies made by individuals with the disease are the same as the ones in more common autoimmune diseases , like type 1 diabetes . Therefore , investigating the other autoantibodies produced by individuals with APS-1 could reveal the autoantibodies driving other autoimmune diseases . Autoantibodies bind to specific regions of healthy proteins , and one way to identify them is to use hundreds of thousands of tiny viruses in a technique called proteome-wide programmable phage-display , or PhIP-Seq . Each phage carries one type of protein segment . When mixed with blood serum from a patient , the autoantibodies stick to the phages that carry the target proteins for that autoantibody . These complexes can be isolated using biochemical techniques . Sequencing the genes of these phages then reveals the identity of the autoantibodies’ targets . Using this technique , Vazquez et al successfully pulled 23 known autoantibodies from the serum of patients with APS-1 . Then , experiments to search for new targets began . This revealed many new autoantibodies , targeting proteins found only in specific tissues . They included one that targets a protein found on cells in the gut , and another that targets a protein found on egg cells in the ovaries . Matching the PhIP-Seq data to patient symptoms confirmed that these new antibodies correlate with the features of specific autoimmune diseases . For example , patients with antibodies that targeted the gut protein were more likely to have gut symptoms , while patients with antibodies that targeted the egg cell protein were more likely to have problems with their ovaries . Further investigations using PhIP-Seq could reveal the identities of even more autoantibodies . This might pave the way for new antibody tests to diagnose autoimmune diseases and identify tissues at risk of damage . This could be useful not only for people with APS-1 , but also for more common autoimmune diseases that target the same organs ."," This study aimed to identify new potential target molecules that may be attacked by the immune system in a specific genetic disorder called autoimmunne polyendrocrinopathy syndrome type I (APS1). To do this, they used a technique called ""programmable"" phages (short pieces of DNA) which were then displayed on the surface of bacteria. They exposed these bacteria to blood samples taken from patients who had been diagnosed with ASP1. By doing so, they could see if any of these phages would bind to antibodies present in the patient's blood sample. Through this process, they identified several new potential molecule targets that might be attacked in ASP 1. They also looked at how well some of these newly identified molecules matched up with other known autoimmunes disorders. Overall, their findings suggest that using this approach may help us better understand why certain autoimmume disorders occur and potentially lead to new ways to treat them. However, further studies will need to be done before any firm conclusions can be made about whether or not these molecules play a role in causing ASPI. It is important to note that while this study provides interesting insights into the possible causes of ASPAI, it does not directly impact our current ability to diagnose or treat this condition."
"The rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria is challenging clinicians , and some infections are now resistant to almost all of the drugs that are currently available . Some types of bacteria – such as mycobacteria , which include the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy – can only acquire antibiotic resistance from mutations that alter their existing genes . The process by which bacteria develop resistance to multiple drugs is generally viewed as a stepwise accumulation of different mutations . However , the role of individual mutations that increase a bacterium’s resistance to multiple antibiotics has not been fully explored . Gomez , Kaufmann-Malaga et al . exposed bacteria from the species Mycobacterium smegmatis , a cousin of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis , to a mixture of relatively low concentrations of different antibiotics that should kill the bacteria relatively slowly . Hundreds of small bacteria cultures were grown in parallel , and only a fraction of them developed antibiotic-resistant members . Gomez , Kaufmann-Malaga et al . identified mutations in these bacteria that unexpectedly gave the bacteria resistance to several unrelated classes of antibiotics . Individual mutants carried single mutations in different components of the ribosome , a complex molecular machine that helps to build proteins inside cells . As well as increasing their resistance to antibiotics , these mutations also reduced the growth rate of the bacteria . This meant that when the bacteria were grown in an antibiotic-free environment they survived less well than non-mutant bacteria . However , the mutations gave the bacteria an advantage in environments that contained many different antibiotics , as they could more easily develop mutations that made them more resistant to other drugs . Thus , the mutant bacteria can serve as stepping-stones toward the development of high-level resistance to multiple drugs . Further work will now explore whether this phenomenon occurs in a range of other bacterial species , including the bacteria that cause tuberculosis . While new antibiotics are desperately needed , a better understanding of how bacteria evolve the ability to resist the effects of antibiotics will help us to preserve the usefulness of existing and future drugs ."," In this study, researchers found that certain genetic mutations (changes) in bacteria's ribosomes could help them survive exposure to different types of antibacterial drugs. This finding suggests that even if one type of drug is effective against a bacterial infection, other types of drugs may still pose a threat due to the presence of such ribosmal mutations. It also means that bacteria may evolve ways to become resistant not just to one but multiple types of antimicrobials at once. Therefore, it is important to consider using a combination of different types or classes of antifungals when treating fungal infections to reduce the chances of developing resistance. Additionally, the authors suggest that some of these ribsomal mutants might be useful in identifying new targets for antimicriobal drugs. However, further studies are needed to understand how these mutations work and whether they can indeed lead to multi-drug resistance. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the potential for multi-antimicrobal resistance when choosing treatments for infectious diseases. By taking into account the possibility of cross-resistance between different types and classes of drugs, clinicians can make more informed decisions about which treatment options to use and potentially prevent the development of multi-resistant strains."
"In the body , cancer cells can rely on different nutrients than normal cells , and they can use these nutrients in a different way . What cancer cells consume also depends on what is available in their immediate environment . In a tumor , cells grab nutrients from the ‘interstitial’ fluid that surrounds them , but what is present in this liquid may vary within tumors arising in different locations . Understanding what nutrients are ‘on the menu’ in specific tumors would help to target diseased cells while sparing healthy ones , but this knowledge has been difficult to obtain . To investigate this , Sullivan et al . used a technique called mass spectrometry to measure the amounts of 120 nutrients present in the interstitial fluid of mouse pancreas and lung tumors . Different levels of nutrients were found in the two types of tumors , and analyses showed that what was present in the interstitial fluid depended on the type of cancer cells , where the tumor was located , and what the animals ate . This suggests that cancer cells may have different needs because they are limited in what they have access to . It remains to be seen whether the nutrients levels found in mouse tumors are the same as those in humans . Armed with this knowledge , it may then be possible to feed cancer cells grown in the laboratory with the nutrient menu that they would have access to in the body . This could help identify new cancer treatments ."," Cancer cells need energy to grow and survive. They get this energy by using glucose (a kind of sugar) or other molecules as fuel. In order to use these fuels, they have to be broken down into smaller pieces inside the cells. This process is called “metabolism.” There are many things that can change how much glucoses and other fuels there are around the cancer cells. For example, some chemicals made by the body can help break down sugars faster so that more energy is produced. Other chemicals can slow down the breakdown of sugars and make less energy available. Some types of cancer cells also produce their own chemicals that can speed up or slow down how quickly the sugars are broken down. All of these different chemicals together are called “microenvironmental” because they come from outside the cancer cell itself. Scientists wanted to know what kinds of chemicals were around cancer cells in mice. So, they took samples of blood and special fluids from inside the tumors and measured all of the different chemicals that were in them. By doing this, they could see which chemicals were higher or lower in the mouse tumors compared to normal tissue or blood. They found that there were differences in the amounts of certain chemicals in the blood versus the tumour-surrounding fluids. Also, they found that the amount of certain chemical was different depending on where the tumours grew in the body. Finally, they showed that changing what the mice ate changed the amount certain chemicals around the tumorous tissues."
"On average , in Europe , men can currently expect to live till the age of 75 and women until they are 82 . But what will their lifespans be in the next decades ? Reliable answers to this question are essential to help governments plan for future health care and social security costs . While medical improvements are likely to further extend lifespans , lifestyle factors can result in temporal distortions of this trend . Yet , most estimates of future life expectancy fail to consider changing lifestyles , as they only use past mortality trends in their calculations . This can make these projections unreliable: for example , increases in smoking rates among Northern and Western European men led to stagnating male life expectancies in the 1950s and 1960s , but these picked up again after smoking declined . The same pattern is showing for women , except it is lagging as they took up smoking later than men . Based simply on the extrapolation of past mortality trends , current projection models fail to consider the past and predicted modifications of life expectancy trends prompted by changing rates of health behaviours – such as increases followed by ( anticipated ) declines in alcohol consumption and obesity rates , similar to what was observed with smoking . To produce a more reliable forecast , Janssen et al . incorporated trends in smoking , obesity , and alcohol use into life expectancy projections for 18 European countries . The predictions suggest that life expectancy for women in these countries will increase from 83 . 4 years in 2014 to 92 . 8 years in 2065 . For men , it will also go up , from 78 . 3 to 90 . 5 years . In the future , this integrative approach may help to track the effects of health-behaviour related prevention policies on life expectancy , and allow scientists to account for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . In the meantime , these estimates are higher than those obtained using more traditional methods; they suggest that communities should start to adjust to the possibility of longer individual lifespans , and of larger numbers of elderly people in society ."," This study looked at how long people could expect to survive in different European countries based on data collected up until 2 years ago. They used three factors known to affect health and death rates – smoking, being overweight or obese, and drinking too much alcohol. By considering these factors along with historical patterns of changes in life expectancies, they were able to predict what might happen in the next few decades. Their predictions suggest that most people across Europe may be living about two years longer than expected compared to other methods. If this prediction comes true, it would mean that many more people will reach old age in the coming years. Overall, their findings highlight the importance of addressing unhealthy behaviors such as smoking, excessive drinking, and obesities if governments want to reduce healthcare costs associated with treating chronic diseases later in life. It also means that societies need to prepare for an influx of older adults who will require additional support and resources. Finally, while some countries already have high life expectances, this study suggests that even those countries could see further increases in the years ahead. However, there are limitations to this study since it only looks at three major risk factors for poor health. Other important factors like access to quality education, healthy food, clean water, sanitation, and safe places to exercise are not considered here but should be included in future studies to get a better picture of how life spans might change in the decades to come."
"All recommended treatments against malaria include a drug called artemisinin or some of its derivatives . However , there are concerns that Plasmodium falciparum , the parasite that causes most cases of malaria , will eventually develop widespread resistance to the drug . A strain of P . falciparum partially resistant to artemisinin was seen in Cambodia in 2008 , and it has since spread across Southeast Asia . The resistance appears to be frequently linked to a mutation known as pfk13 C580Y . Southeast Asia and Amazonia are considered to be hotspots for antimalarial drug resistance , and the pfk13 C580Y mutation was detected in the South American country of Guyana in 2010 . To examine whether the mutation was still circulating in this part of the world , Mathieu et al . collected and analyzed 854 samples across Guyana between 2016 and 2017 . Overall , 1 . 6% of the samples had the pfk13 C580Y mutation , but this number was as high as 8 . 8% in one region . Further analyses revealed that the mutation in Guyana had not spread from Southeast Asia , but that it had occurred in Amazonia independently . To better understand the impact of the pfk13 C580Y mutation , Mathieu et al . introduced this genetic change into non-resistant parasites from a country neighbouring Guyana . As expected , the mutation made P . falciparum highly resistant to artemisinin , but it also slowed the growth rate of the parasite . This disadvantage may explain why the mutation has not spread more rapidly through Guyana in recent years . Artemisinin and its derivatives are always associated with other antimalarial drugs to slow the development of resistance; there are concerns that reduced susceptibility to artemisinin leads to the parasites becoming resistant to the partner drugs . Further research is needed to evaluate how the pfk13 C580Y mutation affects the parasite’s response to the typical combination of drugs that are given to patients ."," Scientists found a new type of Plasma Faglopara (Pf) called K13 which makes it harder for people to get better when they take medicine. This kind of PF was already seen before in other places where there are many cases of Malaria. They also looked closely at this kind of Pf and saw that it came from different parts of the world. It seems like some people got this kind in Guyanna too but not very often yet. Because of how hard it is to treat people who have this kind, it will be harder to stop the spread of Maleria in those areas. People should keep taking their medicines as directed so we can stop Malaria sooner rather than later. If you feel sick, go see your doctor right away! Don't wait until it gets worse. Doctors know what tests to do now so they can find out if you have Malaria fast. That way, you can start treating it right away and prevent it from spreading to others around you. Remember, everyone can help stop Maleria from spreading faster by using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, sleeping under bed nets, and staying inside during times of day when mosquitoes bite. Keep up the good work, everyone!"
"Inside human and other animal cells , filaments known as microtubules help support the shape of the cell and move proteins to where they need to be . Defects in microtubules may lead to disease . For example , genetic mutations affecting a microtubule component called TUBB4A cause a rare brain disease in humans known as H-ABC . Individuals with H-ABC display many symptoms including abnormal walking , speech defects , impaired swallowing , and several cognitive defects . Abnormalities in several areas of the brain , including the cerebellum and striatum contribute to these defects . . In these structures , the neurons that carry messages around the brain and their supporting cells , known as oligodendrocytes , die , which causes these parts of the brain to gradually waste away . At this time , there are no therapies available to treat H-ABC . Furthermore , research into the disease has been hampered by the lack of a suitable “model” in mice or other laboratory animals . To address this issue , Sase , Almad et al . generated mice carrying a mutation in a gene which codes for the mouse equivalent of the human protein TUBB4A . Experiments showed that the mutant mice had similar physical symptoms to humans with H-ABC , including an abnormal walking gait , poor coordination and involuntary movements such as twitching and reduced reflexes . H-ABC mice had smaller cerebellums than normal mice , which was consistent with the wasting away of the cerebellum observed in individuals with H-ABC . The mice also lost neurons in the striatum and cerebellum , and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord . Furthermore , the mutant TUBB4A protein affected the behavior and formation of microtubules in H-ABC mice . The findings of Sase , Almad et al . provide the first mouse model that shares many features of H-ABC disease in humans . This model provides a useful tool to study the disease and develop potential new therapies ."," Scientists found a gene called TUBBA4A that causes a type of brain disease called H- ABC. This disease affects how well the brain works by causing problems with the way the brain makes connections between different parts of itself. These problems can cause people who have this disease to feel weak or tired easily, have trouble moving around, or have other symptoms. To study this disease more closely, scientists made a special ""mouse"" version of the gene that has the same problem as the human gene. They then studied these mice and found out that they had similar problems to what happens in humans with this disease. Specifically, the mice had less connections between parts of their brains than normal, which could explain some of the symptoms that happen when you have this brain disease. Overall, this shows us that the gene TUBBB4A plays an important role in helping our brains work normally, and if it doesn't work properly we might get sick. It also helps us understand better why certain diseases like H- ABc happen, so maybe one day we can find ways to help people who suffer from them. However, there is still much more to learn about this disease and its treatment options, so more research needs to be done before we know exactly how to fix it."
"Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect , affecting nearly 1 in 100 children born . It can involve a weak heart , narrowed arteries , narrowed heart valves , or the main arteries of the heart switching places . These conditions can be fatal if untreated and often need surgery to correct . The mother’s blood sugar levels during pregnancy can have a large effect on how likely the baby is to have congenital heart disease . If a pregnant woman has poorly controlled diabetes with rapidly fluctuating sugar levels , she may be at a higher risk of having a child with the condition . High sugar levels in the mother’s blood make the baby up to five times more likely to have congenital heart disease . It has been difficult to find out exactly how sugar levels interfere with heart development because diabetes can affect the fetus in many ways . Nakano et al . used stem cells and experiments in pregnant mice with diabetes to hone in on how high sugar levels affect the fetus’s heart development . First , heart cells were grown from human stem cells , and exposed to high levels of glucose in a dish . This revealed a new mechanism for how high sugar levels affect heart formation: the cells created too many nucleotides , the building blocks of molecules such as DNA . It turns out that high glucose levels boosted a chemical process in the cell known as the pentose phosphate pathway . Some of the products of this pathway are nucleotides . This made the cells divide rapidly , but did not allow them to mature well compared with cells exposed to normal levels of sugar . In another experiment , Nakano et al . found similar results in pregnant diabetic mice . The heart cells in mouse fetuses also divided quickly but matured slowly when exposed to high sugar levels . An estimated 60 million women at an age to have children have diabetes . These new findings help us to understand why and how these women are more likely to have children with congenital heart disease , and further study will hopefully lead to a better way to prevent this condition ."," This study looked into how glucoses affect the development of heart cells using a special type of cell called human plutipotential stem cells (hPSCs). They used a chemical recipe to control what hPSC cells became and then measured their growth, structure, metabolism, electrical properties, and ability to contract. When they exposed these cells to higher than normal amounts of glucosis, it caused them to develop less matured heart cells. This could be because when there was more glucosity present, the cells were able to make certain molecules faster which made them grow bigger before becoming fully developed. This suggests that having too much sugar in your body while you're pregnant might cause problems with your baby's heart development. It also provides some evidence as to why babies born to mothers who have diabetes often have heart defects or other issues with their hearts. Overall, this study shows us that even small changes in the amount of sugar in our bodies can impact how our organs develop. Therefore, it is important to maintain healthy dietary habits throughout one’s life, especially during pregnancy. If you are concerned about your health or the health of your unborn child, always consult with a healthcare professional. 10.1371/journal.pone.0268945"
"Most plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil via structures called roots . The shape , size , and structure of a plant's root system can change over its lifetime as the plant responds to changes in their local environment . For example , if water is scarce , a plant may develop a very deep root system that is more efficient at capturing water . Understanding how root systems respond to environmental cues may help us to identify the genes and processes involved . In this study , Rellán-Álvarez et al . report a new live-imaging platform for analyzing root architecture and its regulation . This platform is called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( or GLO-Roots for short ) and uses ‘luminescent’ markers that allow growing roots to be visualized when plants are grown in thin , soil-filled , transparent pots . GLO-Roots can track the growth of the plant roots as well as the activity of genes that respond to environmental stress . Rellán-Álvarez et al . developed a software tool called GLO-RIA ( GLO-Roots Image Analysis ) to analyze the resulting images . GLO-RIA performs several different types of image analysis , including one that detects the position , length , and direction of roots , as well as their shape and depth . Rellán-Álvarez et al . tested the GLO-Roots techniques in various ways , for example , by analyzing the effects that different conditions have on the growth of the roots of the model plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana . Depriving the plants of a nutrient called phosphorous caused the roots to grow more horizontally than when phosphorus is plentiful , presumably to allow the plants to expand their search for phosphate in the upper layers of the soil , where this nutrient is usually more abundant . On the other hand , a shortage of water caused the roots to grow more vertically to access water stored deeper in the soil . GLO-Roots can also be used to measure the water content of soil at different depths and how this influences the architecture of the root . Further experiments on tomato plants and a grass species called Brachypodium distachyon revealed the different architectures of their root systems . Rellán-Álvarez et al . propose that this system could be used to study the roots of other plant species in a variety of environmental conditions . This will provide a more detailed understanding of the ways that different plants adapt in response to changes in their environment ."," Scientists need new ways to study how plants grow underground because it's hard to see what they do there. They want to know more about something called ""multidimension"" which means looking at many things together. They made a special place where plants can grow under the ground but also be seen by cameras. Now scientists can look at how plants deal with different things happening around them all at once. It helps scientists understand how plants react to different things better than before. This way, scientists will learn more about how plants work and survive underground. It might help them make plants stronger or healthier so they can live well even when conditions aren't perfect. That would be good! Science makes life better!

"Cells respond to stressful conditions by changing which of their genes are switched on . Such stress-specific genes are typically switched off again when the conditions improve , but can remain primed and ready to be switched on again when needed . This phenomenon is known as “epigenetic transcriptional memory” and allows for a faster or stronger response to the same stress in the future . In fact , these memories can last for a long time , even after the cell divides many times . Inside cells , most of the DNA is wrapped tightly around proteins called histones . To activate – or transcribe – a gene , the DNA must be re-packaged to allow better access for specific proteins including the enzyme called RNA polymerase II . This repackaging involves a number of changes including chemical modification of the histone proteins . Genes that have been previously transcribed under stress are packaged in a different way so that they are poised and ready for the next time they are needed . However , the details of this process were not clear . Using yeast as a model , D'Urso et al . have dissected the changes that are responsible for priming genes to respond to future events . The yeast gene INO1 , which shows transcriptional memory , was studied in cells by characterizing the proteins bound at and around the gene and the histone modifications in the region . D'Urso et al . found that a protein called SfI1 bound to this gene only during transcriptional memory and that this binding was critical to start the phenomenon . Further experiments showed that transcriptional memory also required altering two protein complexes that normally bind to genes when they are switched on . One complex , which includes an enzyme that modifies histones , was altered so that the histones at the INO1 gene were marked in a unique way . The other complex was responsible for recruiting an inactive , poised form of RNA polymerase II to the gene , which allowed the gene to be activated when needed . In addition , D'Urso found that other genes that show transcriptional memory in yeast , as well as such genes in human cells , were also marked in the same ways . A future challenge will be to understand how different conditions in different organisms can lead to transcriptional memory . Further studies could also explore how this memory phenomenon is inherited and how it influences an organism’s fitness ."," In yeast, when a gene is turned on or off, it leaves behind marks on the DNA called ""epigenetic"" marks. These marks help remember whether a gene should be on or not the next time it gets activated. This process is called ""transcriptional"" memory. Scientists have found out how these marks work in yeasts. They also found out that two proteins called Set1 and Med1 are used differently than they normally would be to make sure that the right marks get left at the right genes. It turns out that this happens all over different kinds of organisms including humans! So, even though some things might look very different between species, there could still be similarities hidden inside them. That's pretty cool! And now scientists know more about how our bodies remember what genes to turn on or turn off. Who knows? Maybe knowing this will help doctors find better ways to treat diseases like cancer someday. Yay science! :) (end of summary) Note: I am an AI language model trained on common English, so my output may not always follow academic writing conventions.

"Injuries to the brain and spinal cord cause disability in millions of people worldwide . Physical rehabilitation can restore some muscle control and improve mobility in affected individuals . However , no current treatments provide long-term relief from the unwanted muscle contractions and spasms that affect as many as 78% of people with a spinal cord injury . These spasms can seriously hamper a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks and get around independently . A few treatments can help in the short term but have side effects; indeed while Botox injections are used to paralyse the muscle , these also reduce the chances of useful improvements . As such , better therapies for muscle spasms are needed; especially ones that reduce spasms in the arms . Rats with injuries to the spinal cord between their middle to lower back typically develop spasms in their legs or tail , and rat models have helped scientists begin to understand why these involuntary movements occur . Now , Kathe et al . report that cutting one specific pathway that connects the brain to the spinal cord in anesthetised rats leads to the development of spasms in the forelimbs as well . Several months after the surgery , the rats had spontaneous muscle contractions in their forelimbs and walked abnormally . Further experiments showed that some other neural pathways in the rats became incorrectly wired and hyperactive and that this resulted in the abnormal movements . Next , Kathe et al . asked whether using gene therapy to deliver a protein that is required for neural circuits to form between muscles and the spinal cord ( called neurotrophin-3 ) would stop the involuntary movements in the forelimbs . Delivering the gene therapy directly into the forelimb muscles of the disabled rats a day after their injury increased the levels of neurotrophin-3 in these muscles . Rats that received this treatment had fewer spasms and walked better than those that did not . Further experiments confirmed that this was because the rats’ previously hyperactive and abnormally wired neural circuits became more normal after the treatment . Together these results suggest that neurotrophin-3 might be a useful treatment for muscle spasms in people with spinal injury . There have already been preliminary studies in people showing that treatment with neurotrophin-3 is safe and well tolerated . Future studies are needed to confirm that it could be useful in humans ."," Injury to the brain or spine can cause problems like loss of movement and stiffness due to too much muscle activity. This condition called spastic paralysis affects many people who have experienced strokes or traumatic injuries. Researchers found that injecting a protein called neurotrophy into injured rat's muscles could help improve their ability to move around again and decrease spastic reactions. They also saw changes in how nerve cells communicate with each other in the spine which may be responsible for these improvements. These results suggest that this treatment might be helpful for people suffering from spastic conditions caused by brain or spinal injuries. Further studies will need to confirm whether it would work on humans. Overall, this study provides new insights about potential treatments for spastic disorders. It shows promise for using gene therapies to treat these conditions more effectively than current methods. However, further testing is needed before such approaches can be used safely and widely in clinical settings. By sharing these findings, researchers hope to encourage others to learn more about them and possibly develop better ways to prevent and treat spastic diseases. This could lead to improved quality of life for patients and their families. Additionally, understanding more about how our nervous system works under different circumstances could inspire future innovations in medicine and technology."
"After the DNA in a gene has been transcribed into messenger RNA , portions of the mRNA called introns are removed , and the remaining stretches of mRNA , which are known as exons , are spliced together . Within eukaryotic cells , a process known as alternative splicing allows a single gene to encode for multiple protein variants by ensuring that some exons are included in the final , modified mRNA , while other exons are excluded . This modified mRNA is then translated into proteins . Eukaryotic cells also contain proteins that bind to RNA to regulate alternative splicing . These RNA-binding proteins are often found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells , and their involvement in splicing may be linked to other processes in the cell such as mRNA localization and translation . It has also become clear over the past two decades that certain types of RNA-binding proteins , including NOVA proteins , are only found in neurons , and that these proteins have been best characterized as alternative splicing regulators . Recent work has also suggested that they also have important roles in regulating neuronal activity and development , and that their actions in neuronal nuclei and cytoplasm might be coordinated . Now Eom et al . use the predictive power of a high throughput sequencing and crosslinking method termed HITS-CLIP to show that NOVA proteins can indirectly regulate cytoplasmic mRNA levels by regulating the process of alternative splicing in the nucleus to produce ‘cryptic’ exons in the brains of mice . The presence of these exons in the mRNA leads to the production of premature termination codons in the cytoplasm . These codons trigger a process called nonsense-mediated decay that involves identifying mRNA transcripts that contain nonsense mutations , and then degrading them . These cryptic exons were seen in mice missing the NOVA proteins , where they are expressed in abnormally high levels; in normal mice , these exons have not been seen before , hence they were termed ‘cryptic’ . Eom et al . also show that these cryptic exons are physiologically relevant by inducing epileptic seizures in mice . Following the seizures , they find that the NOVA proteins up-regulate and down-regulate the levels of different cryptic exons , leading to changes in the levels of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs , including proteins that inhibit further seizures . Overall the results indicate that , by controlling the production of various proteins in neurons , these previously unknown cryptic exons have important roles in the workings of the brain ."," In this study, researchers found that a certain type of brain cell called ""neuron"" has something called ""cryptic exon"" inside its genes. They discovered that another molecule called ""nuclear overexpression protein"" or ""NOVA"" can control how much of this kind of gene gets made into a protein. However, they found out that NOVA does not work directly on the part of the gene where it makes the protein. Instead, NOVA works on other parts of the same gene, like inside an ""intron."" When NOVA interacts with the intron, it causes the cryptic section to be removed from the gene. If the crypt is left in the gene, then the gene will make less copies of itself because the crypt will cause the gene to break down faster. So if there are more copies of the crypt, then there will be fewer copies of protein being made from those genes. Researchers have already shown that when some types of cells get too excited, they start making more copies than usual of their own genes. Now, researchers show that NOVAs help keep the amount of protein made from each gene at just the right level so that everything stays balanced. Finally, researchers showed that having too little NOVA could lead to problems with electrical signals in the brain, such as seizures."
"Sleep affects memory: if you do not sleep well after a learning task , chances are you will not be able to recall whatever you tried to learn earlier . This is seen in almost all animals ranging from the fruit fly Drosophila , to mice and humans . However , the precise details of how memory and sleep are connected remain unclear . Drosophila is an excellent model for teasing out the connections between memory and sleep . This is because its brain has a simple and well-studied memory region that contains a pair of nerve cells called the dorsal paired medial neurons . These neurons enable memories to be stored for the long term . Here , Haynes et al . asked whether these neurons can also affect sleep , and if so , how . The experiments show that the dorsal paired medial neurons promote sleep in fruit flies . The neurons release a signaling molecule called GABA , which is detected by a type of neighboring ‘mushroom body’ neuron that usually promotes wakefulness . This leads to increases in the levels of chloride ions in the mushroom body neurons , but no change in the levels of calcium ions and a molecule called cAMP , which indicates that GABA inhibits these cells . Flies that have lower levels of two receptor proteins that detect GABA sleep less than normal flies . Haynes et al . 's findings suggest that dorsal paired medial neurons deactivate their neighbors to promote sleep in fruit flies . This result was unexpected because current models of memory formation propose that dorsal paired medial neurons can activate the mushroom body neurons . Understanding how inhibiting mushroom body neurons influences memory will require researchers to reassess these models ."," Sleep helps us remember things better, but it’s not always easy to figure out how this happens. In order to understand more about how our brains help us learn new stuff during sleep, scientists looked at fruit flies. They found two special “sleep” cells called DPM neurons that help us sleep when we need to. When these cells don’t work properly, the fly can’t fall asleep even after being awake all day! Scientists also know that another group of cells called MB neuron alpha/beta cells make sure we stay awake. So, what do the DPM cells do? Well, they actually stop the MB neuronal beta cells from making us wake up so we can get some rest! This shows us that sometimes, sleeping is really important for helping us learn and remember new things later on. And now we know why those specific DPM and MB neurones are so important – because they help us both learn and sleep better! Cool, huh?! Just like taking a nap after studying all day, it turns out that getting enough shuteye is pretty helpful for remembering everything we learned. Who knew that taking a snooze could be so smart? Science is amazing! 😴📚🐝"
"Our genetic material , in the form of molecules of DNA , provides instructions for many different processes in our cells . To issue these instructions , particular sections of DNA are copied to make a type of molecule called ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) . Some of these RNA molecules contain instructions to make proteins , but others—known as non-coding RNAs—regulate the activity of genes in cells . The genetic information within RNA is encoded by the sequence of four different chemical parts called ‘nucleotides’ . RNA can exist as a single strand of nucleotides , but the nucleotides can also pair up in specific combinations to form sections of double-stranded RNA . Therefore , a single strand of non-coding RNA can fold into a complex three-dimensional shape that contains loops , twists , and bulges . The three-dimensional structures of non-coding RNAs are crucial for their roles in cells , but the variety and complexity of shapes that they can form makes it technically difficult to study them . In 2008 , researchers developed a new method called MOHCA that can map the positions of nucleotides that are close together in the three-dimensional structure . Highly reactive chemicals are attached to the nucleotides and these can react with , and damage , other nearby nucleotides . By detecting which nucleotides have been damaged , it is possible to map the positions of these nucleotides and decipher the structure of the RNA molecule using computer algorithms . MOHCA is a promising approach , but the initial methods to find the damaged nucleotides were tedious and required specialized equipment . Now , Cheng , Das et al . —including some of the researchers involved in the 2008 work—have developed an improved version of MOHCA that uses readily available RNA sequencing techniques to find the damaged nucleotides . The RNA sequencing data are then analyzed by a new algorithm in the Rosetta computer modeling software . Cheng , Das et al . used this newly developed ‘MOHCA-seq’ and Rosetta to reveal the structures of a human non-coding RNA and several other non-coding RNA molecules to a much higher level of detail than before . Together , MOHCA-seq and Rosetta provide a rapid method for researchers to decipher the three-dimensional structure of non-coding RNAs . This method is likely to speed up the analysis of the complex structures of non-coding RNAs . It will be useful in future efforts to work out what roles these RNAs play in cells , including their activity in cancer , neurodegeneration , and other diseases ."," Scientists use different techniques to study the shape of molecules like RNA. However, these techniques cannot always tell them exactly what they need to know about the shapes of certain types of RNA molecules. In this article, scientists describe a new technique that can help solve problems with other techniques by using something called ""multidimension chemical mapping"" or MCM. They used MCM to figure out more details about the shape and position of parts of some RNA strands. They also showed that MCM could be combined with another technique called ""mutant and map"" to make it easier to understand the shape better. Overall, MCM seems like a useful tool for studying the shapes and positions of different parts of RNAs. It might even be able to work on long pieces of RNSs! By combining MCM with other tools, researchers may be able learn more about the way RNAS work. This could help us understand things like diseases and ways to treat them. For example, one type of RSNA called the ""lariat cap"" helps cells divide properly. Researchers think that changes to its shape might cause cancer. So, if we know more about how this piece works, maybe we'll find a way to stop those changes from happening."
"Animals often need to adapt to changes in food availability in order to survive . When food is in short supply and animals are starving , their energy reserves are low . To conserve energy , behaviours that are not essential to survival , like mating , are put on hold . Instead , animals channel their energies into foraging strategies that may help them find new food sources . These behavioural changes are likely to be caused by changes in brain activity triggered by starvation . It is not entirely clear how starvation changes the brain and consequently how an animal behaves . It is also difficult to study how the brain regulates behaviour in response to environmental changes like food availability in larger animals with more complex nervous systems . Instead , scientists often study less complex animals like a type of worm called C . elegans , because this model organism has a simpler nervous system and it is easier to observe its feeding behaviours . Previous observations have revealed that well-fed worms travel backwards when they are hungry , revisiting sites where they have previously found food . Yet , when the worms are starving , they move forward more frequently , presumably to find new sources of food . Now , Ahmadi and Roy show starving worms activate an enzyme called AMP-activated protein kinase ( or AMPK for short ) . Worms genetically engineered to lack this enzyme tend to move backward when they are starved , instead of moving forward like typical starving worms . This shows that AMPK triggers a wider search for new food sources . Further experiments showed that AMPK acts to inhibit two receptors , which in turn , affects the activity of two different neurons . These two neurons work together to change the animal’s behaviour and boost the likelihood the animal will be able to find a new food source when food is scarce . More complex animals , including humans , also have the receptors and brain cells targeted by AMPK in response to starvation . Future studies are needed to determine whether a similar chain of events occurs in creatures with more complicated nervous systems ."," When we don't have enough food, it can affect our behavior. For example, we may become more motivated to find food or eat what little food is available. Scientists wanted to understand how hunger affects behavior. They found that a molecule called AMP Kinase helps control how hungry animals behave. This happens because AMP kinase makes certain brain cells respond differently to chemicals from other brain cells. These chemical messages help animals decide whether they should move around looking for food or stop moving until something comes along. So, when an animal doesn't eat much, their brains send different signals so they will do things like keep moving even if there isn't any food nearby. This way, the animal has a better chance of finding some food soon. In short, scientists learned about a special kind of cell in the brain that helps us make decisions based on how hungry we feel. And they figured out how those cells work together to change how we act under different conditions. That means that now we know more about why we might feel hungrier than usual sometimes and want to eat more or eat differently than normal. It also tells us more about how our bodies use all kinds of information to figure out what to do next. That could help doctors come up with new ways to treat people who have problems deciding when to eat or what foods they like best."
"The brain shows spontaneous activity all the time , even when we are sleeping . A technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has revealed that this spontaneous activity can occur in distinct groups of brain regions at roughly at the same time . Each group is referred to as a resting-state network and the brain regions that make up these networks are largely the same between individuals , and between the sleep and awake states . However , when spontaneous brain activity is measured in rodents and humans using electrodes , it appears that there are actually waves of electrical activity that spread both within and across resting-state networks . In other words , these studies suggest that brain regions tend to become active in turn rather than at the same time . This led Mitra et al . to question whether the techniques used to analyze fMRI scans of spontaneous brain activity might have overlooked differences in the timing of brain activity . Mitra et al . used a new technique to analyze fMRI data from healthy adult volunteers . The experiments show that brain regions are activated in a different order depending on whether the individuals are awake or asleep . Specifically , in conscious individuals information from the senses is first processed by a structure deep within the brain called the thalamus before it is passed to the brain’s outer layer , known as the cortex . During deep sleep , this flow of information is reversed and signals are instead sent from the cortex to the thalamus . This may contribute to our loss of sensory awareness during sleep , and even to the occurrence of dreaming . The exchange of informationbetween resting-state networks also becomes disorganized during sleep . This lends support to the idea that the coordinated transfer of information between networks in the awake state may contribute to consciousness . Future experiments should explore differences in spontaneous brain activity in different phases of sleep , and investigate how such activity is able to spread throughout the brain ."," In this study, researchers used special imaging techniques to look at how different parts of the brain communicate with each other while people were awake or sleeping. They looked specifically at very slow movements of blood inside the brain, which can be seen using certain types of MRI scans. During sleep, they saw some differences compared to when people were just sitting there quietly without moving. Specifically, they noticed that communication between different areas of the brains was organized differently than it was during wakefulness. For example, they found that communication broke down between two separate groups of regions called ""resting state networks"" (RSNs). They also found that the way that one part of the network communicated with another changed direction from waking to sleep states. Finally, they noted that communication within these RSN groups became more organized during sleep than during wakeful rest. Overall, their results suggest that sleep may play an important role in helping our brains organize themselves into efficient ways of working together. It could also help us understand why we need sleep after being awake all day. Further research will be needed to fully understand what exactly happens in our brains during sleep, but this study provides new insights about how different areas talk to each other during both wakefulness and sleep. By understanding more about how our brains work, scientists might find better ways to treat problems like insomnia or fatigue caused by lack of sleep."
"To make sense of the world around us , we constantly try to work out the relationship of new information to other things that we already know , and sort our knowledge into pre-existing mental frameworks , or “schemas” . This makes learning new things that are related to a schema , as well as remembering this knowledge , easier . The process of making these mental connections is thought to involve an extensive brain network . Separate types of information are stored in different brain regions within this network , yet to link this information together , the brain must combine them into a single representation . Wagner et al . have now investigated which brain regions are involved in recombining separate information . Human volunteers were trained to interpret the positions or colors of pairs of circles with different rules . The combination of these separate types of information formed a mental schema that could be used as a “weather forecast” . The design of the experiment meant that measuring the brain activity of the volunteers during the task ( using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging ) allowed the brain regions involved in retrieving the different parts of such a schema to be distinguished . Twenty-four hours later volunteers returned to use the mental schemas that they had learned to predict the weather . Retrieving which weather conditions the circle pairs represented activated a network of regions in the volunteers’ brains . Further analysis revealed that some of these regions showed specific activity patterns in response to remembering information about only one element of the task ( for example , only the rules or only the visual information ) . However , the different aspects of the task all appeared to be integrated by a brain region called the angular gyrus . This suggests that the angular gyrus is responsible for combining separate memory parts and pieces of information into a single representation . It is able to do so by connecting to brain regions that code for such specific aspects , although this only occurs 24 hours after the mental schemas have been established . Future studies could investigate the result of damage to the angular gyrus: different pieces of information might not be combined , or could result in an incorrect memory during retrieval . Finally , since the angular gyrus has been related to a wealth of different mental processes , it remains a challenge for future research to ""converge"" these findings and to understand the underlying computations ."," In this study, researchers wanted to find out how our brain represents memories of things like facts or events (which they call “schemas”). They did an experiment where people learned some rules about objects and then had to remember them later. When people remembered the rules, certain parts of their brains were activated. By looking at what areas of the brain got activated when people remembered each part of the rules separately, the researchers could figure out where in the brain all the separate pieces of the memory came together again. They found that the area of the back of the right side of the person’s brain called the angular gyri was responsible for putting everything together. This area of brain gets more active as people get older and have more experiences, so it might help us put together all the things we learn throughout life. It also seems to be important for helping us make connections between things we already know and new things we want to remember. So, even though we may not always think about it, our brain is constantly making connections between old and new information based on what we already remember! That means that if you hear something interesting now, your brain will start thinking about other things you already know that might be connected somehow. And who knows? Maybe you'll end up learning something new because of it!"
"Cancer cells can leave the site where they arise and travel to other organs . Very few of the cancer cells that make this journey will survive long enough to form new tumors ( also known as ‘metastases’ ) . However , melanoma cells – the most aggressive type of skin cancer cells – are an exception . These cells will often colonize their nearest lymph nodes and melanoma patients with metastases in the lymph nodes are less likely to survive than those patients without them . Previous studies have shown that melanoma cells arrive at a lymph node and first proliferate in the region at the edge of this organ , known as the subcapsular sinus , before moving to the center . However , it was not understood how melanoma cells manage to survive in the subcapsular sinus . Now , Singh and Choi have tracked fluorescent melanoma cells to observe how they interact with the cells in the lymph nodes in mice . Melanoma cells have ‘sticky’ proteins coated with sugars on their surface . The results show that when the cells arrive in the subcapsular sinus these proteins bind to a receptor called Siglec1 located on the surface of immune cells called macrophages , which are also present . In this way , the melanoma cells anchor themselves in the lymph node . Moreover , binding Siglec1 helps melanoma cells survive and proliferate . In a last set of experiments , Singh and Choi deleted the enzyme responsible for making the sugar molecules in melanoma cells . Without the sugar coat , melanoma cells were less able to anchor themselves and grow within the mouse lymph nodes . Lymph nodes are often the first stop for melanoma cells on the way to other organs . Therefore , understanding the interaction between melanoma cells and macrophages might be useful for developing therapies that could disrupt this process and treat this aggressive cancer ."," This study looked at how melanocytes spread from one part of the body to another through the lymps. They found that certain types of immune cells called ""subcapsular"" sinus cells help these melanocytess spread. These immune cells have something on them called Sigelce1. Melanocyte cells stick to this Sigelece1, which helps them move around and find their way into other parts of the lmp system. Once they get there, the melanomyces start growing again. If you don't have enough of these special immune cells, then the meloncytes have trouble spreading. Overall, this study shows that these specific immune cells play an important role in helping melanomys spread throughout the body. It also suggests that targeting these immune cells could be used as a new treatment option for people with melanomic cancer. By understanding more about how melanonmyes spread, doctors may be able to develop better ways to treat patients before their disease gets worse. This could include developing new drugs or using different combinations of existing treatments. More studies are needed to learn more about these immune cels and how they interact with melamonmyes. This will help us understand how to best use them to fight cancer."
"The brain of a developing fetus has a big job to do: it needs to create the important connections between neurons that the individual will need later in life . This is a challenge because the first connections that form between neurons are sparse , weak and unreliable . They would not be expected to be able to transmit signals in a robust or effective way , and yet they do . How the nervous system solves this problem is an important question , because many neurological disorders may be the result of bad wiring between neurons in the fetal brain . When an adult human or other mammal “sees” an object , visual information from the eye is transmitted to a part of the brain called the thalamus . From there it is sent on to another part of the brain called the cortex . The cortex also provides feedback to the thalamus to adjust the system and often acts as a brake in adults to limit the flow of information from the eyes . Murata and Colonnese investigated whether the fetal brain contains any “booster” circuits of neurons that can amplify weak signals from other neurons to help ensure that information is transferred accurately . The experiments monitored and altered visual activity in the brains of newborn rats – which have similar activity patterns to those observed in human babies born prematurely . Murata and Colonnese found that in these rats the feedback signals from the cortex to the thalamus actually multiply the visual signals from the eye , instead of restraining them . This causes a massive amplification in activity in the developing brain and explains how the fetal brain stays active despite its neurons being only weakly connected . The booster circuit stops working just before the eyes first open ( equivalent to birth in humans ) as the connections between neurons become stronger , and is replaced by the braking mechanism seen in adults . This is important , because continued amplification of signals in the adult brain might cause excessive brain activity and epilepsy . The findings of Murata and Colonnese may therefore help to explain why epileptic seizures have different causes and behave differently in children and adults . The next step following on from this work is to find out how the braking mechanism forms in young animals . Future studies will also focus on understanding the precise role the booster circuit plays in early brain development ."," Retinas produce electrical signals called waves during fetal development. These waves help shape the way neurons process light in different parts of the developing brain. It's not known if there are any circuits inside the brain that can regulate these waves. In this study, researchers found that a specific type of connection between two areas of the baby mouse brain, called the thalmus and the cortex, helps transmit the waves from the retina to the thlalmis. They also found that this connection changes when mice open their eyes. Before they open their eyelids, the connection transmits the waves. After they open up their eyilids, it stops transmitting them. This suggests that the brain has its own ways of controlling how the waves develop before the eyes open. This finding could be useful for scientists who want to learn more about how babies see after birth. It may also be helpful for doctors who treat children with problems related to vision or brain development. However, further studies need to be done on humans to confirm if this phenomenon happens similarly in human brains. Overall, this study provides new insights into how the brain regulates neural activity during development. Further research should focus on identifying other potential mechanisms involved in this process. Additionally, future work needs to investigate the role of these circuits in shaping sensory processing beyond infancy."
"New egg cells form via a specialized kind of cell division called called meiosis , and will pause at key stages in this process before continuing their development . One of these pauses occurs before the egg cell is fertilized . At fertilization , the egg cell becomes “activated” , development resumes , and it starts forming into an embryo . Molecules deposited in the egg cell when it originally formed are used to control these earliest stages of embryonic development . These molecules include messenger RNA molecules ( mRNAs for short ) , which can be “translated” to build proteins . In fruit flies , an enzyme called PNG kinase regulates the translation of hundreds of mRNA molecules during the period after the pause , when the maturing egg cell is activated and the embryo begins to develop . It is not well understood what activates and inactivates the kinase to limit its activity to this period of time . However , it was known that a protein called GNU was needed to bind to the PNG kinase to make it active . CyclinB/CDK1 is another kinase , and in contrast to PNG it is highly active when the egg cell is paused . When the egg cell is activated for embryonic development , the levels of this second kinase drop sharply and meiosis is completed . Like all kinases , CyclinB/CDK1 attaches phosphate groups onto other molecules , and Hara et al . now show that CyclinB/CDK1 can modify the GNU protein in this way . The added phosphate groups prevent GNU from binding to the PNG kinase , meaning that the high levels of CyclinB/CDK1 during the pause stop GNU from activating the PNG kinase . However , when the egg cell is activated , the level of CyclinB/CDK1 declines so that there are not enough of these molecules to add phosphates onto GNU . This leaves GNU free to activate the PNG kinase , allowing this kinase to control the translation of mRNA molecules . Furthermore , the activity of PNG kinase leads to the destruction of GNU , and this feedback loop limits this kinase’s activity to the narrow window of time in which it is needed . The fruit fly is the second example of an animal in which the activity of a kinase essential for embryonic development has been linked to the completion of meiosis ( the other being the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans ) . The use of this strategy in two such different animals suggests that it may also be common to many other animals , including humans . Further investigation is now needed to determine if this is indeed the case ."," A recent study found that a protein called GNU plays an important role during fertilization in fruit flies. During this process, the egg's DNA is replicated so it can produce two copies of each chromosome (one from each parent). These two sets of chromosomes will then combine into one set in the new embryo. Before fertilisation happens, there is a special type of cell division called meioses. During these divisions, the number of chromatids is reduced from four to two. However, before fertilizaton occurs, another event needs to happen - the proteins on the egg need to get ready for the next stage of development. One way they do this is through a process called translation, where genetic code is used to make specific types of proteins. Translation is very different between eggs and embryos, because the egg needs to store all its resources until it is time to become an embryonic cell. To achieve this, the proteome of the egg is carefully controlled throughout the entire process. One group of proteases, called PNG, helps to control how much certain proteins are made. It does this by adding chemical groups to those proteins, which either turns them off or allows them to work properly."
"Nerve cells , called neurons , are one of the core components of the brain and form complex networks by connecting to other neurons via long , thin ‘wire-like’ processes called axons . Axons can extend across the brain , enabling neurons to form connections—or synapses—with thousands of others . It is through these complex networks that incoming information from sensory organs , such as the eye , is propagated through the brain and encoded . The basic unit of communication between neurons is the action potential , often called a ‘spike’ , which propagates along the network of axons and , through a chemical process at synapses , communicates with the postsynaptic neurons that the axon is connected to . These action potentials excite the neuron that they arrive at , and this excitatory process can generate a new action potential that then propagates along the axon to excite additional target neurons . In the visual areas of the cortex , neurons respond with action potentials when they ‘recognize’ a particular feature in a scene—a process called tuning . How a neuron becomes tuned to certain features in the world and not to others is unclear , as are the rules that enable a neuron to change what it is tuned to . What is clear , however , is that to understand this process is to understand the basis of sensory perception . Memory storage and formation is thought to occur at synapses . The efficiency of signal transmission between neurons can increase or decrease over time , and this process is often referred to as synaptic plasticity . But for these synaptic changes to be transmitted to target neurons , the changes must alter the number of action potentials . Although it has been shown in vitro that the efficiency of synaptic transmission—that is the strength of the synapse—can be altered by changing the order in which the pre- and postsynaptic cells are activated ( referred to as ‘Spike-timing-dependent plasticity’ ) , this has never been shown to have an effect on the number of action potentials generated in a single neuron in vivo . It is therefore unknown whether this process is functionally relevant . Now Pawlak et al . report that spike-timing-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized rats can change the spiking of neurons in the visual cortex . They used a visual stimulus ( a bar flashed up for half a second ) to activate a presynaptic cell , and triggered a single action potential in the postsynaptic cell a very short time later . By repeatedly activating the cells in this way , they increased the strength of the synaptic connection between the two neurons . After a small number of these pairing activations , presenting the visual stimulus alone to the presynaptic cell was enough to trigger an action potential ( a suprathreshold response ) in the postsynaptic neuron—even though this was not the case prior to the pairing . This study shows that timing rules known to change the strength of synaptic connections—and proposed to underlie learning and memory—have functional relevance in vivo , and that the timing of single action potentials can change the functional status of a cortical neuron ."," This study looked at how the brain processes information about objects or events around us. It found that individual ""sparks"" called action potentials (AP) help our brains make sense of what we see. When these APs happen one after another very quickly, they tell our brains different things. For example, if an AP happens right before we see something, then our brains know that whatever we just saw must be important because it caused the AP. But if an SP happens right after we see it, then it tells our brains that whatever it was might not have been so important after all. By changing the order of these AP sparks, our brains can learn new things and adapt to our environment. Just like how you might feel more excited if someone shouted ""Fire!"" right before you saw a fireworks show, compared to if they told you there would be a show later. Or maybe you would feel less excited if they had already told you about the show, but hadn't said whether it was going to be good or bad. In this case, your feelings (the APs) helped you decide how to react to seeing the fireworks (visual input). That's kind of how our brains work too! 💡🎆"
"Signaling molecules such as the hormone epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) activate a range of responses inside cells . The responses often involve proteins being chemically modified to change how active they are , which in turn controls specific processes happening inside the cell . One type of modification involves certain enzymes adding or removing molecules known as phosphate groups from specific proteins . For example , an enzyme called PP2B ( also known as calcineurin ) is able to remove phosphate groups from a variety of proteins . PP2B plays crucial roles in many different processes in animals including immune responses , nerve cell signaling and heart activity , and is the target of several medicinal drugs that suppress the immune system . Since PP2B plays so many roles in the body , these drugs often have unintended side effects . Therefore , studying how the body regulates this enzyme may help us to understand what causes these side effects . Previous studies have shown that PP2B is activated by calcium ions , which can act as signals in many different situations inside cells . A protein called AKAP79 anchors PP2B to specific locations in the cell so that it only operates where it is needed . Some evidence suggests that calcium ions affect how AKAP79 and PP2B interact , but it is not known how this works . Nygren et al . investigated how the PP2B enzyme and AKAP79 protein interact inside human cells and in cell-free systems . The experiments showed that short regions within the AKAP79 protein are responsible for binding to PP2B . These regions and the flexible structure of the entire AKAP79 protein work together to fine-tune how PP2B responds to calcium ions . In the presence of higher levels of calcium ions , another ‘auxiliary’ region of AKAP79 also binds to PP2B . This auxiliary region binds to a site on the enzyme where an immunosuppressive drug called cyclosporine can also bind . This suggests that AKAP79 binding to PP2B may affect the sensitivity of the PP2B enzyme to cyclosporine . This study demonstrates that the activity of PP2B can be precisely controlled by interactions with proteins such as AKAP79 . Further work on these interactions may help develop more effective drugs that cause fewer side effects in patients ."," Scientists have discovered that there is a special molecule called AKARP79 which helps another molecule, called PP2b or calcinephrin, do its job properly. Normally, when cells need it, PP2a comes out of storage so it can turn off other chemical signals. However, sometimes we want PP2 to stay inactive because if it gets activated too quickly, it could cause problems. To keep PP2 inactive, scientists found that they could use something called AAKRP79 to bind to it and hold it still. They also found that there was one part of AAKPR79 that was flexible and not very strong. By making this part stronger, they were able to make sure that PP2 would be held even more tightly than before. When they did this, they noticed that PPB stayed bound up much better and didn't come out as easily. This means that the cell only activates PPB when it really needs to, and not just at any old time. In addition, they found that this change made PPB less likely to get turned on by certain drugs that normally stop it from working. Overall, their findings show how changing just one small part of a molecule can help us control exactly when and where different chemicals are turned on or off inside our bodies."
"The brain receives information from the world through the senses . In particular , cells called sensory neurons can detect signals from the environment and relay the information to the brain . A critical test of how well we understand the role of a given sensory neuron is whether it is possible to predict its activity under natural conditions . Previous research has succeeded in predicting the responses of sensory neurons in animals that were anaesthetised . However , it has been difficult to extend this approach to awake animals . Mice and other rodents rely on their whiskers to tell them about their surroundings . Campagner et al . set out to predict how the sensory neurons that send information from whiskers ( or ‘whisker neurons’ ) to the brain would respond in awake mice that were actively exploring an object in their environment . The approach involved using high-speed video ( 1 , 000 frames per second ) to film the whiskers while the mice used them to explore a thin metal pole . At the same time , Campagner et al . recorded the electrical activity of the whisker neurons . The videos were used to calculate the forces acting on the whiskers , and then computational models were used to relate the activity of the neurons to the forces . This approach allowed Campagner et al . to predict the responses of the whisker neurons , even when the mice were exploring the pole freely and unpredictably , simply from knowledge of the forces that were acting on the whiskers . Together , these findings move the field of neuroscience forward by showing that sensory signals and neuronal responses can be correlated even in an awake animal . A key challenge for the future will be to further extend the approach to investigate how the signal conveyed by sensory neurons is transformed by neural circuits within the brain ."," Scientists have studied how our brains process information about what touches us through our skin (tactile sensation). They know that when something touches our skin, signals travel up our nerves into our brain. But it's not always clear exactly how these signals get processed once they reach the brain. To help solve this problem, scientists used special tools to record the electrical activity coming from specific nerve cells called ""primary sensory"" neurons. While recording this electrical activity, they also watched how tiny hairs on mouse faces (called whiskers) moved while the mouse touched things around them. This way, the researchers could see how much pressure was being applied to the whiskers at any one time. Then, using computer programs, they tried to figure out which aspects of all this information would best match the electrical activities they saw in the nerve cells. What they found was pretty surprising! When there wasn't anything touching the whiskered part of the mouse face, most of the electrical signals happening inside its brain still came from those same ""primary"" nerve cells that had been touched before. However, instead of just measuring how much the whisking motion itself might have caused these signals, the scientists looked at another measure – the amount of force or pressure being put on the end of each whisker. By doing so, they discovered that the electrical signal patterns matched better with the pressure measurements than with the actual movements of the whiskering themselves. So now, scientists think that even though we usually feel like we're sensing things because of some kind of outside touch, many of those feelings actually come from inside our own bodies! That means that sometimes, even if nothing is touching us, our brains may still be able to make us feel like something is there."
"The cells of animals , yeast and other eukaryotes all contain a network of filaments known as the actin cytoskeleton that helps to maintain cell shape . When a cell grows , it needs to carefully regulate its actin cytoskeleton to allow the cell to increase in size . A family of proteins known as the myosins bind to actin filaments and act as motors to undertake many cellular activities , which include reorganising the cytoskeleton and moving cargo around the cell . Myosin proteins contain three distinct sections: a motor domain that exerts force against actin filaments , a long region known as the lever arm and a tail region that binds to cargo and other molecules . Cells control the activities of myosin proteins in several ways . For example , a protein known as calmodulin binds to the lever arm of myosin to regulate how long and stiff it is , and it can also alter how the motor domain behaves . Furthermore , proteins known as kinases add molecules called phosphate groups to specific parts of the myosin proteins in response to changes in the environment surrounding the cell . Previous studies reported that one of these sites is within a section of the lever arm region that binds to calmodulin . However , it remained unclear whether the action of the protein kinase affects how calmodulin regulates myosin . Baker et al . used biochemical approaches to study a myosin protein from fission yeast called myosin I . The experiments showed that a protein kinase system called TORC2 added phosphate groups to myosin I affecting how the protein interacted with calmodulin and also alter the shape of the lever arm . This in turn directly affected the ability of the yeast cells to modulate their actin cytoskeleton and grow in response to changes in the nutrients available in the surrounding environment . Myosin proteins and TORC2 play critical roles in many processes happening in healthy cells and these proteins are often badly regulated in many types of cancer . Therefore , these findings may benefit research into human health and disease in the future ."," Cells need to be able to sense and react to changes around them. They do this using different types of signals from inside or outside the cells. These signals can change how the cells grow and divide, move, or interact with other cells. To make these reactions happen, cells use proteins called kinases and phosphatases. Kinases add chemical groups to other proteins, while phosphates take those groups off again. This process is called posttranslational modification. In this study, researchers found out that another protein, called TOR, uses a specific kinase to modify a protein called myosine. This modified form of myostein has a new shape and interacts differently with other protections. By changing its shape, it affects how well myosite moves along an actin chain. This allows cells to better adapt to their surroundings and prepare for things like division or moving into a new place. Overall, this study shows us how important it is for cells to have many ways to communicate and react based on what happens around them and inside of them. It also helps us understand more about how cells work and how they might go wrong during diseases. We hope that this will help scientists find new ways to treat or even prevent these conditions."
"During many cellular processes , the double helix must be transiently unwound so that the enzymes responsible for maintaining the genome can access the two strands . During DNA synthesis , for instance , the two strands of DNA are first separated and then used as templates for the production of new strands . The role of destabilizing , separating and unwinding the double helix falls to enzymes known as DNA helicases . Helicases are also involved in separating strands of nucleic acids during myriad other cellular processes , including DNA repair , transcription and translation . While the functions of helicases are clear , the precise mechanisms by which they unwind DNA are not . Here , Qi et al . have investigated the mechanism of a helicase called XPD , which is involved in DNA repair and the initiation of transcription of DNA into RNA . Using optical tweezers—in which a laser beam is used to exert extremely small forces on a single DNA molecule—they followed the activity of individual molecules of XPD as they unwound DNA with base pair resolution . Qi et al . observed that the helicase unwinds DNA strands 1 base pair at a time , but that it sometimes moves backwards by 1 base pair and at other times makes 5 base pair backward and forward steps . The frequency of these backwards steps depends on the availability of ATP , and the sequence of the DNA . Due to the high resolution of the data , Qi et al . were able to correlate these stepping dynamics with the DNA sequence with base pair level accuracy . While some helicases actively separate the strands , using energy derived from ATP to break the hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases , Qi et al . showed that XPD appears to take advantage of momentary separations that arise spontaneously between base pairs . As well as providing insights into the role of XPD in DNA repair and transcription , the work of Qi et al . presents a method that could be used to explore the mechanisms of other helicases . Given that the unwinding mechanism described here is likely to be a universal feature of enzymes related to XPD , the current work could shed light on a number of other cellular processes involving XPD-like helicases , such as homologous DNA recombination , inter-strand cross-link repair , and accurate chromosome segregation ."," Scientists have studied how a protein called XPD works when it separates strands of DNA. They used tiny magnets to hold onto one end of each strand while watching as the other end was pulled away slowly. As the two strands were separated, they could see exactly which bases were being pulled apart first. By doing this, scientists found out that sometimes the XPD protein would take small steps forward, but often it would step backwards before moving forward again. Sometimes these steps were very large. When looking more closely at what caused these steps, scientists discovered that certain types of bases seemed to cause the protein to make larger steps than others. These findings help us understand better how proteins like XPD separate strands during important processes such as cell division or making copies of DNA molecules. It also helps us learn about different ways that proteins can use to break up pairs of bases on DNA. In the future, researchers might study whether all kinds of proteins work in similar ways. This will tell us even more about how cells divide and copy their DNA. It might also teach us new things about diseases that happen because something goes wrong with those processes. For example, cancer happens when cells don't divide properly. If scientists find out more about these proteins, maybe they can figure out a way to fix problems so that cells behave normally."
"Living cells store their genetic code written in molecules of DNA , with two strands of DNA twisted together to form the familiar double helix . When a cell prepares to divide , it must unwind its DNA so that the individual strands can be copied . Enzymes known as DNA helicases play a vital role in this unwinding process; yet , it is not completely clear how these enzymes move along the DNA . Schlierf et al . have now developed a new approach to see how an individual DNA helicase called G40P unwinds the DNA double helix . The experiments used a molecular ruler to measure the DNA unwinding and showed that the helicase opened the double helix one letter of genetic code at a time . Also , specific sequence of letters within the DNA molecules could slow down and stop G40P or even cause it to move backwards . DNA helicases work closely with other proteins inside cells to perform their task . DNA primases , for example , are enzymes that create the starting points for making new strands of DNA . Schlierf et al . found that the primase DnaG could also prevent G40P from moving backwards on the DNA , a new and unexpected function of DnaG . These findings contribute to an ongoing debate among researchers with partially contradictory models for how DNA helicases unwind the DNA double helix . Although originally from a virus , G40P is similar to a helicase enzyme found in bacteria . Therefore , a better understanding of this helicase may lead to new ways to stop bacteria copying their DNA , which might one day become new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections ."," Scientists have studied a type of protein called G4OHP that helps move along and separate strands of DNA during cell division. They used a special technique to watch this process happen one base pair at a time. What they found was surprising – the protein only moves forward one base at a times when it needs to overcome obstacles like a single bond between two bases. This means that sometimes the protein can get stuck if there’s an issue with just one bond! But if another kind of protein (DnaG) is around, then the G4OP protein keeps moving forward smoothly. Overall, this study shows us more about how cells make sure DNA gets copied correctly. It also gives scientists clues about how different parts of the same protein work together to help them do their jobs. In the future, researchers might be able to use what they learned here to help treat diseases caused by problems with copying or separating DNA. For example, they could find ways to make the G39P protein work better so that DNA copies themselves properly. Or maybe they will learn new things about other kinds of proteins related to G49P that cause disease. That would be really cool! And who knows? Maybe someday we'll even be able"
"The instructions for producing proteins in the cell are copied from DNA to molecules known as messenger RNA . If there is an error in the messenger RNA , this causes incorrect proteins to be produced that could potentially kill the cell . Cells have a special detection system that spots and removes any messenger RNA molecules that contain errors , which would result in the protein produced being too short . For this error-detecting system to work , a protein called UPF1 must be modified by an enzyme called SMG1 . This enzyme only binds to and modifies the UPF1 protein at sites that contain a specific pattern of amino acids – the building blocks that proteins are made from . However , it remained unclear how SMG1 recognizes this pattern and interacts with UPF1 . Now , Langer et al . have used a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy to image human SMG1 bound to a segment of UPF1 . These images were then used to generate the three-dimensional structure of how the two proteins interact . This high-resolution structure showed that protein building blocks called leucine , serine and glutamine are the recognized pattern of amino acids . To further understand the role of the amino acids , Langer et al . replaced them one-by-one with different amino acids to see how each affected the interaction between the two proteins . This revealed that SMG1 preferred leucine at the beginning of the recognized pattern and glutamine at the end when binding to UPF1 . SMG1 is member of an important group of enzymes that are involved in various error detecting systems . This is the first time that a protein from this family has been imaged together with its target and these findings may also be relevant to other enzymes in this family . Furthermore , the approach used to determine the structure of SMG1 and the structural information itself could also be used in drug design to improve the accuracy with which drugs identify their targets ."," Scientists have discovered that certain proteins called PIKKS help regulate important biological functions within cells. One type of these proteins, called SMG-1, helps control a process called nonsense mediated messenger ribonucleoprotein decoy (NMD). During this process, if there is a mistake in the protein being made, then the cell will stop making it. To do this, SMG 1 needs to add something called phosphate onto another protein called UPF 1. However, scientists did not know exactly how SMGG 1 was able to put this phosphor on UPF I. In order to figure out how SMGC 1 does this, they used special cameras to take pictures of SMGC I adding phosphot to UPF L. They were also able to use chemicals to slow down the process so that they could get a picture of it. By doing this, the researchers were able to discover how SMGT 1 adds phosphat to UPH I. This discovery can help us better understand how cells make sure that only good proteins are made inside them. It may also be helpful for developing new ways to treat diseases caused by mistakes in proteins. For example, some types of cancer are caused by errors in proteas that help keep cells from growing too fast."
"Animals have very different patterns of skin pigmentation , and these patterns can be important for survival and reproduction . Zebrafish , for example , have horizontal dark and light stripes along their bodies , while a closely related fish called the pearl danio has an almost uniform pattern . The dark stripes of the zebrafish contain cells called melanophores , while the lighter regions contain two other types of cells known as xanthophores and iridophores . These pigment cell types interact with each other to create stripes . The iridophores establish the lighter stripes and specify the position and orientation of the dark stripes . They also produce a protein called Csf1 , which allows the xanthophores to mature . As the stripes form , melanophores present in lighter stripes move into nearby dark stripes . Pearl danios also contain these three types of pigment cells , but these cells remain intermingled giving the fish their uniform color . Eom et al . have now used microscopy to image pigment cells in zebrafish and pearl danio to uncover how interactions between these cells differ in species with different pigment patterns . The technique involved tagging pigment cells with fluorescent markers and using time-lapse imaging to track them during the formation of the adult pigmentation pattern . The experiments show that stripes form in zebrafish because the cells that make the xanthophores form long , thin projections that extend to neighboring melanophores . These so-called ‘airinemes’ deliver materials to melanophores and help to clear the melanophores from interstripe regions , partly by activating a cell communication pathway called Delta-Notch signaling . These cell projections are mostly absent from the cells that make xanthophores in the pearl danio due to differences in when Csf1 is produced . This alters the timing of when the xanthophores develop , leading to the loss of long-distance airineme signaling . Eom et al . ’s findings identify a new way in which cells can communicate and an unanticipated cell behavior that contributes to a striking difference in the pigmentation patterns of zebrafish and pearl danio . Future studies should further our understanding of these unique projections and reveal whether they are produced by other types of cells ."," Scientists have found a new way that some fish can change their color patterns based on how close together certain types of skin cells called “xanthophoeres” are located. This happens because these skin cells communicate with each other using special cell extensions called “projections.” These projections allow the xanphoere cells to talk to each other even when they are far apart. When two xanthophoric cells come closer together, the projections help them send more signals to each another than if they were farther away. In this case, the skin cells end up being able to make the fish’s body turn into either striped or solid colored depending on whether the cells get too close together or stay too far apart from each other. This discovery helps us understand how animals like fish can evolve different colors just by changing how closely related cells communicate. It also shows us a new type of way that cells can talk to one another! This finding could be useful for scientists who want to learn more about how we humans develop our own unique appearances as well as how to potentially treat diseases caused by problems between cells communicating properly. For example, maybe there will be ways to fix those kinds of problems by helping important cells to grow longer projections so that they can better connect with nearby cells around them."
"The membrane surrounding each living cell contains a variety of proteins that carry out different roles . For example , proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases help a cell to receive signals from its external environment . Receptor tyrosine kinases span the membrane so that one part of the protein known as the ectodomain sticks out from the surface of the cell , while another part ( called the kinase domain ) sits inside the cell . When a signalling molecule binds to the ectodomain , the kinase domain becomes active and starts to add chemical groups called phosphates to other proteins . This process , known as phosphorylation , changes the protein’s activity , which in turn influences the cell’s behaviour . In most cases , the signalling molecule causes two receptor tyrosine kinase proteins to bind to each other and form a “dimer” in which the kinase domains are able to phosphorylate , and thus activate , each other . Female mammals need a receptor tyrosine kinase called DDR1 to develop mammary glands ( the glands that produce milk ) . DDR1 is activated when a signalling molecule called collagen binds to its ectodomain . Unlike many other receptor tyrosine kinases , DDR1 exists as a dimer even before it binds to collagen , so it is not clear how collagen activates DDR1 . One possibility is that collagen causes several DDR1 dimers to form clusters on the membrane so that kinases on neighbouring dimers can phosphorylate each other . Juskaite et al . explored this idea by pairing up normal DDR1 proteins with mutant versions that are unable to bind to collagen . The experiments show that when collagen binds to the normal DDR1 molecules , DDR1 dimers do indeed form clusters . This enables the normal protein molecules in neighbouring dimers to phosphorylate each other as well as the mutant proteins . In this way , the clustered DDR1 dimers can become active even if the clusters contain one or more mutant versions that are unable to detect collagen . Further experiments show that specific contacts need to form between neighbouring dimers for this phosphorylation to occur . Abnormal DDR1 activity is associated with several diseases including cancer , inflammation and fibrosis . The findings of Juskaite et al . suggest that developing new drugs that can prevent DDR1 from forming clusters may help to treat people with these conditions . Further work is also needed to analyse the size and structure of DDR1 clusters and investigate if other proteins also associate with the clusters ."," Collagens are important proteins found throughout our body. They provide structure and strength to tissues such as skin, bones, muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and organs. However, when these structures become damaged or diseased, they can cause problems like arthritis, cancer, and other health issues. To help treat these conditions, scientists have been studying ways to modify collagens so that they can be used more effectively in medical treatments. One way to do this is by using special molecules called “drug delivery receptors” (DDRs). These receptORS work by binding to specific parts of collagen and then activating them to produce therapeutic effects. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about how one type of DRR called DDR-1 works. They did this by creating different versions of Ddr-1 that were modified in certain ways and then testing their ability to activate when exposed to collagena. Their findings suggest that DDRs may work by forming groups of molecules on cell surfaces that can communicate with each other and trigger changes within cells. This new understanding could lead to better ways to use DDR drugs to treat various illnesses caused by damage to collage-rich tissues."
"Just like animals , plants can become infected and diseased . Among the microbes that infect plants , one group tends to stand out . Named Phytophthora after the Greek for ‘the plant destroyer’ , these fungus-like microbes cause diseases in many species of plant , including important food crops . These diseases are difficult to control , and as a result Phytophthora diseases cost the farming industry billions of dollars every year . Effective control of Phytophthora diseases is likely to depend on scientists first gaining a better understanding of how these microbes infect plants . Also like animals , plants have an immune system to protect themselves from disease . Yet many disease-causing microbes make so-called effector proteins to overcome their hosts’ defenses . Previously in 2015 , researchers reported that one effector made by a species known as Phytophthora sojae could suppress the immune system of soybean plants during the early stages of an infection . But it was not clear how the effector achieved this . Now , Li et al . , who include many of the researchers involved in the 2015 study , go on to show that the same effector , known as PsAvh52 , helps P . sojae to infect soybean plants by interacting with a previously unknown soybean enzyme . The enzyme is a transacetylase , meaning it belongs to a group of enzymes that transfer a chemical marker called an acetyl group on to other molecules including proteins . Li et al . went on to show that the PsAvh52 effector essentially hijacks the transacetylase enzyme , moving it to a location in the cell nucleus where it could chemically modify the proteins that package the soybean plant’s DNA . These chemical changes activate nearby genes that would have otherwise been switched off , and these incorrectly activated genes make the plant more susceptible to the infection . By deciphering one of the strategies that helps P . sojae to infect soybean plants , Li et al . have uncovered two possible approaches that may help to get this plant disease under control . The findings highlight the effector PsAvh52 as a weapon that could be blocked; they also reveal the transacetylase enzyme as a vulnerable point in the plant that could be protected . The next step will be to explore if there are chemical or genetic means that can achieve either of these two goals ."," Scientists have discovered a new way that oomycetes (a type of fungus) can infect plants. Oomycutes produce chemicals called ""effectors"" which help them enter cells. One such effector protein was studied in this experiment. This protein was able to make soybeans more likely to be infected by the oomycutes. It does this by binding to a protein inside the soya bean's cells. This helps the omycutes take over the plant. By understanding how these effectors work, scientists may be better able to protect crops from being destroyed by oomycuetes. This knowledge will also help us understand why some plants are more resistant than others. Understanding this process will allow researchers to develop ways to prevent or slow down crop diseases. This will lead to developing methods to increase food production and reduce waste caused by disease. This discovery has important implications for agriculture as well as basic science. Further studies should focus on identifying other effectors and their targets. They should also investigate whether similar mechanisms exist in other organisms. Finally, they need to find out if there are any negative effects associated with this mechanism. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of plant-oomycete interactions and opens up avenues for future research aimed at improving crop resistance against oomyctes."
"After infecting a cell , a virus reproduces by forcing the cell to produce new copies of the virus , which then spread to other cells . However , cells have evolved ways to fight back against these infections . For example , many mammalian cells contain proteins called restriction factors that prevent the virus from multiplying . The TRIM5 proteins form one common set of restriction factors that act against a class of viruses called retroviruses . HIV-1 and related retroviruses have a protein shell known as a capsid that surrounds the genetic material of the virus . The capsid contains several hundred repeating units , each of which consists of a hexagonal ring of six CA proteins . Although this basic pattern is maintained across different retroviruses , the overall shape of the capsids can vary considerably . For instance , HIV-1 capsids are shaped like a cone , but other retroviruses can form cylinders or spheres . Soon after the retrovirus enters a mammalian cell , TRIM5 proteins bind to the capsid . This causes the capsid to be destroyed , which prevents viral replication . Previous research has shown that several TRIM5 proteins must link up with each other via a region of their structure called the B-box 2 domain in order to efficiently recognize capsids . How this assembly process occurs , and why it enables the TRIM5 proteins to recognize different capsids was not fully understood . Now , Li , Chandrasekaran et al . ( and independently Wagner et al . ) have investigated these questions . Using biochemical analyses and electron microscopy , Li , Chandrasekaran et al . found that TRIM5 proteins can bind directly to the surface of HIV-1 capsids . Several TRIM5 proteins link together to form large hexagonal nets , in which the B-box domains of the proteins are found at the points where three TRIM5 proteins meet . This arrangement mimics the pattern present in the HIV-1 capsid , and just a few TRIM5 rings can cover most of the capsid . Li , Chandrasekaran et al . then analysed TRIM5 proteins from several primates , including rhesus macaques , African green monkeys and chimpanzees . In all cases analyzed , the TRIM5 proteins assembled into hexagonal nets , although the individual units within the net did not have strictly regular shapes . These results suggest that TRIM5 proteins assemble a scaffold that can deform to match the pattern of the proteins in the capsid . Further work is now needed to understand how capsid recognition is linked to the processes that disable the virus ."," Scientists have found out that when they put together different kinds of proteins from monkeys called TRIMs, these proteins can make a net around an HIV virus particle. This net helps stop the virus from infecting cells. They figured this out because they could get pure samples of the protein and virus particles so they could study them closely using special techniques like electron microscopy. It turned out that the way the TRIM proteins made their nets was similar to the way other TRIM protein types did it. That means that even though there are many different kinds and versions of TRIM, all of them still work basically the same way. So now scientists know more about how TRIMPs protect us against HIV infection! In addition, scientists were able to use what they learned about how these protections work to help design new ways to treat diseases caused by other viruses. For example, researchers used some of the things they discovered while studying TRIM to develop a treatment for Ebola virus disease. Because of this, scientists will be better able to find ways to prevent and cure other illnesses too. And if they keep learning more about TRIM and other proteins, maybe one day they'll figure out a way to completely wipe out HIV forever."
"When a sperm cell and an egg cell unite , each contributes half of the genetic material needed for the fertilised egg to develop . This creates opportunities for new and beneficial genetic combinations to arise . To ensure that each new sperm or egg has half a set of chromosomes , reproductive cells undergo a special type of division called meiosis . During the early stages of meiosis , copies of each chromosome—one inherited from the mother , the other from the father—are paired up along the midline of the dividing cell . A protein complex known as the synaptonemal complex acts as a ‘zipper’ , pulling the chromosomes in each pair closer together . The arms of the maternal chromosome and the paternal chromosome are so close that they sometimes cross over and swap a section of DNA . These crossovers perform two critical functions . First , they recombine the genetic information of a cell , so that offspring can benefit from new gene combinations . Second , they help to hold the chromosomes together at a key point of meiosis , reducing the chances that the wrong number of chromosomes ends up in a sperm or egg cell . The zipper structure is essential for meiosis . Disrupting its formation causes infertility and miscarriage in humans and mice , as well as chromosomal disorders like Down's syndrome . Scientists have known about this zipper structure and its importance since 1956 , yet limited information is available about its shape and how it works . Syrjänen et al . used X-ray crystallography to take images of the part of the zipper structure that interacts with the chromosomes . These images , combined with the results of biochemical and biophysical experiments , show that rod-like structures on the zipper link together sites within each chromosome . This not only allows the paired chromosomes to be held together by the zipper , but also compacts them so it's easier for them to cross over and swap genetic information ."," Scientists have found out how a special molecule called SYCP helps keep pairs of chromosomal strands close together while they pair up with their matching partner during cell division. This molecule can twist itself around DNA like a rope around a railing. It also sticks to other copies of itself so it can make long ropes. These ropes help hold the paired chromosoms together as they prepare to exchange genetic material with their match. By doing this, SYCP may play a key role in helping cells divide properly and making new life. In short, scientists think they know why a certain kind of molecule is important for keeping things running smoothly when cells divide. They did this by looking at what happens inside cells using microscopes and by studying the properties of the molecules themselves. They used computer programs to figure out how these molecules work best together. Then they put all the pieces together to come up with an idea about how these kinds of molecules might fit together and do their job. Overall, this study shows us one way that different parts of proteins can stick together to make longer chains or ropes that can be useful for holding things together. It's really cool! And maybe if we understand more about how some of these molecule work, we could use them better in the future to help people get healthy again after being sick."
"A stem cell is a special cell that divides to produce another stem cell , plus a cell that goes on to perform a specific role in the body . The process by which this second cell becomes a specific type of cell is called differentiation . The body contains many different types of stem cells , such as neural stem cells , which go on to form the nervous system , and epithelial stem cells , which give rise to various types of surfaces in the body , such as the skin and the lining of the intestine . Many types of epithelial cells are polarized , which means they have three distinct sides or domains: a basal domain that faces the underlying tissue; an apical domain on the opposite side; and a lateral domain on the side in between the apical and basal domains . The details of how cell polarity is established in epithelial cells are not fully understood , but it is thought to have its origins in the division of epithelial stem cells . Now , by studying follicle stem cells in the ovaries of fruit flies , Castanieto et al . have shown that a process called EGFR signaling ( which is short for epidermal growth factor receptor signaling ) has a central role in establishing the difference between the stem cell and the cell that differentiates . EGFR signaling does this , in part , by promoting a ‘partially polarized state’ in the stem cells: this state is characterized by the presence of a basal domain and a lateral domain but no apical domain . In fully polarized cells , the apical and lateral domains work together to ensure that all three domains remain separated on the surface of the cell , so it was surprising to find that the stem cell could maintain basal and lateral domains without an apical domain . Castanieto et al . propose that this feat is achieved by EGFR signaling , which activates a multiple number of proteins , including one called LKB1 that is known to regulate cell polarity . This work strongly suggests that that changes in cell polarity are among the earliest differences to arise between epithelial stem cells and differentiating cells . In the future , it will be important to determine whether these differences in cell polarity cause the stem cells and the differentiating cells to take on different roles in the tissue . For example , it may be that the lack of an apical domain in the stem cells shields them from signals in the tissue that promote differentiation , thus allowing them to remain undifferentiated . Conversely , the development of an apical domain in the differentiating cells may expose them to signals that promote their differentiation , and also allow them to form a barrier and perform the other roles of epithelial tissue ."," Follicle Stem Cells (FSC) are important for maintaining healthy ovaries by constantly producing new cells. These cells have an unusual shape called “partial” polarity, meaning they have some characteristics of fully polarized cells but not all. Researchers discovered that a protein called Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFr) helps maintain this partial polarity. They also found that another protein called Liver Kinase B 1 (LKB 1) works together with EGFr to help make these cells look more like normal cells. This discovery could lead to better ways to treat diseases related to FSC dysfunction. For example, it might be possible to use drugs targeting EGfr or LKb1 to improve tissue regeneration after injury. However, further studies are needed to understand how exactly these proteins work together to control cell fate decisions. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying FSC function and suggests potential therapeutic targets for treating diseases associated with FSC malfunction. It also highlights the importance of understanding the role of individual proteins in complex biological processes. By studying how these molecules interact within networks, researchers can gain deeper knowledge about disease etiology and develop innovative treatments."
"If all the DNA contained within a single human cell were stretched out it would be about three meters long . To fit this length of DNA into the nucleus of the cell , it is packaged into a compact structure called chromatin . If a cell wants to express one of the genes in the DNA in order to produce a protein , it must unpack part of the chromatin to give an enzyme called RNA polymerase access to the DNA to produce messenger RNA . However , other enzymes—often working with other enzymes , proteins and molecules called cofactors—can modify the structure of the chromatin in a way that leads to changes in the expression of nearby genes . The protein WDR5 binds to enzymes and helps to modify chromatin so that nearby genes can be ‘switched on’ . However , WDR5 also binds to RNA molecules that are not involved in the expression of genes as proteins . These long non-coding RNA molecules ( lncRNAs ) are thought to act as scaffolds that guide the WDR5-enzyme complex to specific stretches of DNA . However , it is not clear if lncRNAs might be performing roles that affect the function of these enzyme complexes directly—as has been observed for other cofactors . Yang , Flynn et al . have now investigated the role of lncRNA molecules further , and identified a pocket on the structure of WDR5 where these molecules bind . A mutation in this pocket that blocks binding to lncRNA did not stop purified WDR5 protein from forming active enzyme complexes when tested in the lab . However , it seems that WDR5 needs to bind to the lncRNAs to function properly inside living cells . WDR5 binds to hundreds of lncRNAs within a cell , and the mutation that blocks this binding reduced both the amount of time that WDR5 protein survives in a cell and the amount of time it spends bound to chromatin . As such , this mutation seems to reduce the ability of the WDR5-enzyme complex to activate chromatin and ‘switch on’ genes . WDR5 is also known to be important in mammalian embryonic stem cells—cells that have the potential to become all the different types of cells found in the body . Yang , Flynn et al . uncovered that the mutations in WDR5 that abolish lncRNA binding also affect the expression of genes that help mouse stem cells to maintain this potential . Since different cell types have distinct patterns of active chromatin , the next challenge will be to understand whether different lncRNAs bind to WDR5 to switch on unique set of genes in each cell type ."," Scientists have found that there is a protein called WDRS5 which helps keep certain genes turned ""on"" so that cells stay as they should. This protein also has a special place where it can stick to RNA molecules. They made a version of this protein that could no longer stick to any kind of RNA. When they put this new version back into cells, it did not work well anymore. It was not able to help turn on certain genes like normal versions of the protein do. They looked at what kinds of RNAS were sticking to normal versions and found some that only normal versions stuck to. Some of those RN As had been shown before to be very important for keeping cells healthy. So their findings show that RNA might be needed by proteins like WDRRS5 to make sure that cells behave normally. More studies will need to be done to figure out how exactly RNA works together with proteins to control whether genes get turned on or off. But overall, scientists think this study gives us more pieces of the puzzle about how different parts of cells talk to each other to decide if genes should be on or not. And knowing more about this may help us find ways to fix problems when things go wrong. For example, maybe one day we'll know how to change the way some RN A s act so that they tell proteins what to do better than they do now. That would let us use our knowledge of how all these parts fit together to try to solve health issues."
"Hybrids arise when two populations of organisms that are related but genetically different mate and produce offspring . Hybridization has long been regarded as one of the many ways species evolve . Studying the changes in the genome that result from this process can provide insights into evolutionary history and predict the outcome of mixing between genetically different populations . In fact , the inability of two organisms to mate and produce viable and fertile hybrids has been used as a way to define species . It has been speculated that the infertility of many hybrids is due to short sequences of DNA in the genome called transposable elements . These elements are sequences of DNA that , when active , can move to a different position in the genome , causing mutations . It is thought that the process of hybridization may be activating transposable elements leading to the infertility often observed in hybrids . The activation of transposable elements in hybrids has been studied in animals and plants , and usually , the hybrids studied were either generated in the laboratory or found in the wild . Fungal species , such as the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus , have hundreds of wild strains , including many hybrids , and can also be crossed in the laboratory to produce new hybrids , allowing a combined approach to studying the activation of transposable elements . Hénault et al . used this yeast to investigate whether hybridization leads to increased activity of transposable elements in fungi . To test this hypothesis , Hénault et al . analyzed the genomes of hundreds of natural strains of S . paradoxus to count and locate their transposable elements and establish evolutionary relationships between them . Next , they crossed different strains in the laboratory to see how the transposable elements would act upon hybridization . If transposable elements were activated by hybridization , then hybrids would accumulate more transposable elements . However , the analyses did not show increased numbers of transposable elements in wild hybrids of S . paradoxus . This could be explained by an actual absence of transposable element activation , or by natural selection eliminating individuals that accumulate more transposable elements . To determine which is the case , Hénault et al . next recreated several hybrids in the laboratory and reproduced them for hundreds of generations . Hybrids were grown in the laboratory such that natural selection was almost incapable of favoring some yeasts over others , allowing the hybrids to accumulate transposable elements . These experiments revealed that hybrids accumulated transposable elements at different and largely unpredictable rates . Indeed , closely related hybrids often had highly different numbers of transposable elements in their genomes after being reproduced in the laboratory . These observations indicate that the accumulation of transposable elements depends on various factors and cannot be easily predicted , and that hybridization may only be a small piece of the puzzle . Additionally , Hénault et al . demonstrated that undomesticated organisms like fungi can provide unique insights into evolutionary hypotheses ."," Transposable Elements (TE) are small pieces of DNA that move around inside cells and change the structure of genes. It has been suggested that when two different types of organisms have babies together, or “hybridize,” these TE’s may become more active and start moving faster. However, most studies looking at this idea have been done in plants or animals. In this study, researchers looked at something called population genome sequencing data from wild strains of yeasts that had hybridized. They did not find any evidence that TE’ s became more active after hybridization. To make sure that there wasn’t some other reason why TE’S might be less active in nature, like maybe certain kinds of TE’ S would get eliminated over time because they caused problems, the researchers also studied what happened to TE’ activity levels in lab strains that were made by mixing together different parental strains. What they found was that how active the TE’ were depended completely on which specific strain you were studying, rather than whether those strains were related to each other or not. This means that even though hybridization didn’t seem to affect TE activity overall, there might still be cases where hybridization does cause changes in TE activity depending on the exact strains involved."
"As an animal embryo develops , specific genes need to be switched on and off at the right time and place to ensure that the embryo’s tissues and organs form properly . Proteins called transcription factors control the activity of individual genes by binding to regions of DNA known as enhancers . Changes in the way DNA is packaged inside cells can affect the ability of transcription factors to access the enhancers , and therefore also influence when particular genes are switched on or off . Sonic hedgehog ( or Shh for short ) is a gene that helps to control various aspects of development including the formation of the limbs and brain . The limb forms from a structure in the embryo referred to as the limb bud . An enhancer called ZRS regulates the precise position within the limb bud where the Shh gene is active in a region designated as the “zone of polarizing activity” . Yet , it was not known how the enhancer is controlled to ensure this pattern is achieved . Peluso et al . investigated the events that lead to ZRS becoming active in mice embryos . The experiments show that the ZRS enhancer exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud: poised , active and inactive . The enhancer is poised in a broad region of the limb bud in cells that are potentially able to switch on the Shh gene . Proteins called fibroblast growth factors drive the enhancer to enter this poised state by altering the way the DNA containing the enhancer is packaged in the cell . Specific transcription factors are able to bind to the poised enhancer and it is the balance between these different transcription factors that activates the enhancer in the zone of polarizing activity . Furthermore in the region of the limb bud where the fibroblast growth factors are not present the ZRS is inactive . These findings show that fibroblast growth factors , in combination with other changes to the ZRS enhancer , restrict the area in which the enhancer is active to a particular region of the limb bud . Differences in enhancer elements are known to underlie a range of inherited characteristics and may influence whether an individual develops many common diseases . In the future , investigating how cells control the activity of enhancers may provide clues to identifying new targets for drugs to treat some of these diseases ."," This study examines how the Sonic Hedgehog gene works in the developing limbs of mice. Specifically, they look at how this gene is activated or turned on in the right place and time during development. They found that another gene, called Fibrolast Growth Factor 8 (Fgf8), helps turn on the Sonc Hedgeghog gene in the very beginning of limb development. However, once the limbs start growing, Fgf9 turns off the Sonoc Hedgeohog gene from growing everywhere in the arm or leg, and only lets it grow in one part of the limp, called the Polarizing Center. To do this, Ffg8 brings in another protein called ETS1, which keeps the Sonco Hedgehoe gene from being turned on. Once the limps have grown a little bit more, another protein, called GABPA comes in and takes away the ETS protein so that the Sonico Hedgeoogene can be turned on again, this time just in the Polarzing Center. So, in short, the Fgfs help turn on a special part of thhe Sonic hedgeohog gen in the correct place in the body, allowing the arms and legs to develop properly."
"The hippocampus is a seahorse-shaped region of the brain that is responsible for learning , emotions , and memory . Like other regions of the brain , it contains many types of neurons that send information to each other by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters across junctions known as synapses . Identifying all the different neuron types in the hippocampus is an important step towards understanding in detail how this brain region works . Thousands of articles have been published that attempt to characterize the neurons in the hippocampus , but many of these studies report only some of the properties of a new neuron type . It is also often difficult to compare the results of different studies , as many different approaches have been used to investigate neuron types , and different studies often use different terms to describe similar features . Wheeler et al . have now created a resource called Hippocampome . org that combines approximately 14 , 000 pieces of experimental evidence about neuron types in the rat hippocampus into a unified database . Analyzing these data has revealed about 3700 different neuron properties . By primarily considering the pattern formed by the branched axons and dendrites , the outputs and inputs that extend out of a neuron , Wheeler et al . have identified over a hundred different neuron types . This classification system also considers how selectively the neuron forms synapses with other cells and the identity of the neurotransmitter released by the neuron . In the future , other features of the neurons will also be incorporated into the system to help refine the classifications . All of this information is online and freely available at Hippocampome . org . This resource is expected to provide a solid basis for analyzing how the hippocampus works , by helping researchers to design and interpret experiments and simulations ."," In order to better understand how different parts of the brain work together, scientists need to know more about all the different kinds of cells that make up each part. One area of the human brain called the “hippocampe” has been studied quite well, but there was no easy way for researchers to find out what they wanted to learn about these cells. To solve this problem, some scientists have created a new website called “Hippocomme.” It includes lots of detailed information about many different kinds or types of cells found in the hippo-campus. They even used special ways of finding information from other websites so that people who want to study the hippopotamus can ask questions like ""what do we know about this kind of cell?"" or ""how does this type of cell fit into the whole system?"" Scientists hope that this will help them learn much more about how our brains work. The website also shows which things still need to be learned! The website is at http://www.hippocomme.org/. If you look at it, you might see that some words are highlighted in yellow. These are special words that were written differently on different websites. By looking at those pages again, you can read more details about whatever you clicked on."
